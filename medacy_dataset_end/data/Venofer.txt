  HIGHLIGHTSKnown hypersensitivity to Venofer
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
  HIGHLIGHTS5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving Venofer.
Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf hypersensitivity reactions or signs of intolerance occur during administration, stop Venofer immediately.
 HIGHLIGHTSMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after Venofer administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion.
 HIGHLIGHTS Only administer Venofer when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions.
  HIGHLIGHTSMost reactions associated with intravenous iron preparations occur within 30 minutes of the completion of the infusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.2)].
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS 5.2 Hypotension Venofer may cause clinically significant hypotension.
 HIGHLIGHTS Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each administration of Venofer.
  HIGHLIGHTSHypotension following administration of Venofer may be related to the rate of administration and/or total dose administered [See Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
   HIGHLIGHTS5.3 Iron Overload Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis.
 HIGHLIGHTS All adult and pediatric patients receiving Venofer require periodic monitoring of hematologic and iron parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation).
 HIGHLIGHTSDo not administer Venofer to patients with evidence of iron overload.
 HIGHLIGHTS Transferrin saturation (TSAT) values increase rapidly after intravenous administration of iron sucrose; do not perform serum iron measurements for at least 48 hours after intravenous dosing [See Dosage and Administration (2) and Overdosage (10)].
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
  HIGHLIGHTSThe following serious adverse reactions associated with Venofer are described in other sections [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2 and 5.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS 6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 HIGHLIGHTS Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients with CKD The frequency of adverse reactions associated with the use of Venofer has been documented in six clinical trials involving 231 patients with HDD-CKD, 139 patients with NDD-CKD and 75 patients with PDD-CKD.
 HIGHLIGHTS Treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by  &#x2030;  2% of treated patients in the six clinical trials for which the rate for Venofer exceeds the rate for comparator are listed by indication in Table 1.
 Patients with HDD-CKD received 100 mg doses at 10 consecutive dialysis sessions until a cumulative dose of 1000 mg was administered.
  HIGHLIGHTSPatients with NDD-CKD received either 5 doses of 200 mg over 2 weeks or 2 doses of 500 mg separated by fourteen days, and patients with PDD-CKD received 2 doses of 300 mg followed by a dose of 400 mg over a period of 4 weeks.

 HIGHLIGHTS*  EPO=Erythropoietin  One hundred thirty (11%) of the 1,151 patients evaluated in the 4 U.S. trials in HDD-CKD patients (studies A, B and the two post marketing studies) had prior other intravenous iron therapy and were reported to be intolerant (defined as precluding further use of that iron product).
 HIGHLIGHTSWhen these patients were treated with Venofer there were no occurrences of adverse reactions that precluded further use of Venofer  [See Warning and Precautions (5)].
HIGHLIGHTS  Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with CKD (ages 2 years and older) In a randomized, open-label, dose-ranging trial for iron maintenance treatment with Venofer in pediatric patients with CKD on stable erythropoietin therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.6)], at least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction was experienced by 57% (27/47) of the patients receiving Venofer 0.5 mg/kg, 53% (25/47) of the patients receiving Venofer 1.0 mg/kg, and 55% (26/47) of the patients receiving Venofer 2.0 mg/kg.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSA total of 5 (11%) subjects in the Venofer 0.5 mg/kg group, 10 (21%) patients in the Venofer 1.0 mg/kg group, and 10 (21%) patients in the Venofer 2.0 mg/kg group experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction during the study.
 HIGHLIGHTS The most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (&gt; 2% of patients) in all patients were headache (6%), respiratory tract viral infection (4%), peritonitis (4%), vomiting (4%), pyrexia (4%), dizziness (4%), cough (4%), renal transplant (4%), nausea (3%), arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2%), hypotension (2%), and hypertension (2.1%).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS 6.2 Adverse Reactions from Post-Marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 HIGHLIGHTS In the post-marketing safety studies in 1,051 treated patients with HDD-CKD, the adverse reactions reported by &gt; 1% were: cardiac failure congestive, sepsis and dysgeusia.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Venofer.
 HIGHLIGHTS Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Anaphylactic-type reactions, shock, loss of consciousness, collapse, bronchospasm, dyspnea, convulsions, light-headedness, confusion, angioedema, swelling of the joints, hyperhidrosis, back pain, bradycardia, and chromaturia.
  Symptoms associated with Venofer total dosage or infusing too rapidly included hypotension, dyspnea, headache, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, joint aches, paresthesia, abdominal and muscle pain, edema, and cardiovascular collapse.
 HIGHLIGHTS These adverse reactions have occurred up to 30 minutes after the administration of Venofer injection.
 Reactions have occurred following the first dose or subsequent doses of Venofer.
 Symptoms may respond to intravenous fluids, hydrocortisone, and/or antihistamines.
Slowing the infusion rate may alleviate symptoms.
 HIGHLIGHTS Injection site discoloration has been reported following extravasation.
 HIGHLIGHTS Assure stable intravenous access to avoid extravasation.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7 DRUG INTERACTIONS   Drug interactions involving Venofer have not been studied.
 HIGHLIGHTSHowever, Venofer may reduce the absorption of concomitantly administered oral iron preparations.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.1 Pregnancy  Pregnancy Category B  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
 HIGHLIGHTS In animal reproduction studies, iron sucrose was administered intravenously to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 13 mg/kg/day of elemental iron (half or equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively) and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to iron sucrose.
 HIGHLIGHTS Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, Venofer should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether iron sucrose is excreted in human milk.
 HIGHLIGHTS Iron sucrose is secreted into the milk of lactating rats.
  HIGHLIGHTSBecause many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Venofer is administered to a nursing woman.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.4 Pediatric Use   Safety and effectiveness of Venofer for iron replacement treatment in pediatric patients with dialysis-dependent or non-dialysis-dependent CKD have not been established.
 HIGHLIGHTS Safety and effectiveness of Venofer for iron maintenance treatment in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with dialysis-dependent or non-dialysis-dependent CKD receiving erythropoietin therapy were studied.
 HIGHLIGHTSVenofer at doses of 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 2.0 mg/kg was administered.
 HIGHLIGHTS All three doses maintained hemoglobin between 10.5 g/dL and 14.0 g/dL in about 50% of subjects over the 12-week treatment period with stable EPO dosing.
 [See Clinical Studies (14.6)]
 HIGHLIGHTS Venofer has not been studied in patients younger than 2 years of age.
 HIGHLIGHTS In a country where Venofer is available for use in children, at a single site, five premature infants (weight less than 1,250 g) developed necrotizing enterocolitis and two of the five died during or following a period when they received Venofer, several other medications and erythropoietin.
 HIGHLIGHTS Necrotizing enterocolitis may be a complication of prematurity in very low birth weight infants.
 No causal relationship to Venofer or any other drugs could be established.
   HIGHLIGHTS8.5 Geriatric Use  Clinical studies of Venofer did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
 HIGHLIGHTS Of the 1,051 patients in two post-marketing safety studies of Venofer, 40% were 65 years and older.
  HIGHLIGHTSNo overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
  HIGHLIGHTSIn general, dose administration to an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS10 OVERDOSAGE
 HIGHLIGHTS No data are available regarding overdosage of Venofer in humans.
 HIGHLIGHTSExcessive dosages of Venofer may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites potentially leading to hemosiderosis.
  HIGHLIGHTSDo not administer Venofer to patients with iron overload.
 [See Contraindications (4)]
 HIGHLIGHTS Toxicities in single-dose studies in mice and rats, at intravenous iron sucrose doses up to 8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area, included sedation, hypoactivity, pale eyes, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, and mortality.
    HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS11 DESCRIPTION
  HIGHLIGHTSVenofer (iron sucrose injection, USP), an iron replacement product, is a brown, sterile, aqueous, complex of polynuclear iron (III)-hydroxide in sucrose for intravenous use.
 HIGHLIGHTS Iron sucrose injection has a molecular weight of approximately 34,000 to 60,000 daltons and a proposed structural formula:
  HIGHLIGHTS[Na2Fe5O8(OH)  &#x20ac;  &#x20ac; 3(H2O)]n  &#x20ac;  &#x20ac; m(C12H22O11)  where: n is the degree of iron polymerization and m is the number of sucrose molecules associated with the iron (III)-hydroxide.
  HIGHLIGHTSEach mL contains 20 mg elemental iron as iron sucrose in water for injection.
 HIGHLIGHTSVenofer is available in 10 mL single-use vials (200 mg elemental iron per 10 mL), 5 mL single-use vials (100 mg elemental iron per 5 mL), 3.25 mL single-use vials (65 mg elemental iron per 3.25 mL), and 2.5 mL single-use vials (50 mg elemental iron per 2.5 mL).
  HIGHLIGHTSThe drug product contains approximately 30% sucrose w/v (300 mg/mL) and has a pH of 10.5 to 11.1.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe product contains no preservatives.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe osmolarity of the injection is 1,250 mOsmol/L.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
  HIGHLIGHTS12.1  Mechanism of Action Venofer is an aqueous complex of poly-nuclear iron (III)-hydroxide in sucrose.
  HIGHLIGHTSFollowing intravenous administration, Venofer is dissociated into iron and sucrose and the iron is transported as a complex with transferrin to target cells including erythroid precursor cells.
 HIGHLIGHTS The iron in the precursor cells is incorporated into hemoglobin as the cells mature into red blood cells.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following intravenous administration, Venofer is dissociated into iron and sucrose.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn 22 patients undergoing hemodialysis and receiving erythropoietin (recombinant human erythropoietin) therapy treated with iron sucrose containing 100 mg of iron, three times weekly for three weeks, significant increases in serum iron and serum ferritin and significant decreases in total iron binding capacity occurred four weeks from the initiation of iron sucrose treatment.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy adults administered intravenous doses of Venofer, its iron component exhibited first order kinetics with an elimination half-life of 6 h, total clearance of 1.2 L/h, and steady state apparent volume of distribution of 7.9 L.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe iron component appeared to distribute mainly in blood and to some extent in extravascular fluid.
 HIGHLIGHTSA study evaluating Venofer containing 100 mg of iron labeled with 52Fe/59Fe in patients with iron deficiency showed that a significant amount of the administered iron is distributed to the liver, spleen and bone marrow and that the bone marrow is an irreversible iron trapping compartment.
 HIGHLIGHTS Following intravenous administration of Venofer,  iron sucrose is dissociated into iron and sucrose.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe sucrose component is eliminated mainly by urinary excretion.
In a study evaluating a single intravenous dose of Venofer containing 1,510 mg of sucrose and 100 mg of iron in 12 healthy adults (9 female, 3 male: age range 32 to 52), 68.3% of the sucrose was eliminated in urine in 4 h and 75.4% in 24 h.
 HIGHLIGHTS Some iron was also eliminated in the urine.
 HIGHLIGHTS Neither transferrin nor transferrin receptor levels changed immediately after the dose administration.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn this study and another study evaluating a single intravenous dose of iron sucrose containing 500 to 700 mg of iron in 26 patients with anemia on erythropoietin therapy (23 female, 3 male; age range 16 to 60), approximately 5% of the iron was eliminated in urine in 24 h at each dose level.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics of Venofer have not been studied.
 HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients
 HIGHLIGHTSIn a single-dose PK study of Venofer, patients with NDD-CDK ages 12 to 16 (N=11) received intravenous bolus doses of Venofer at 7 mg/kg (maximum 200 mg) administered over 5 minutes.
 HIGHLIGHTSFollowing single dose Venofer, the half-life of total serum iron was 8 hours.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe mean Cmax and AUC values were 8545 g/dL and 31305 hr g/dL, respectively, which were 1.42- and 1.67-fold higher than dose adjusted adult Cmax and AUC values.
 HIGHLIGHTS Venofer is not dialyzable through CA210 (Baxter) High Efficiency or Fresenius F80A High Flux dialysis membranes.
  HIGHLIGHTSIn in vitro studies, the amount of iron sucrose in the dialysate fluid was below the levels of detection of the assay (less than 2 parts per million).
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTS13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 HIGHLIGHTSCarcinogenicity studies have not been performed with iron sucrose.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS Iron sucrose was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or the mouse lymphoma assay.
  HIGHLIGHTSIron sucrose was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay using human lymphocytes or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.
  HIGHLIGHTSIron sucrose at intravenous doses up to 15 mg/kg/day of elemental iron (1.2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) had no effect on fertility and reproductive function of male and female rats.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14 CLINICAL STUDIES
 HIGHLIGHTS Five clinical trials involving 647 adult patients and one clinical trial involving 131 pediatric patients were conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of Venofer.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.1 Study A: Hemodialysis Dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (HDD-CKD) Study A was a multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled study in 101 patients with HDD-CKD (77 patients with Venofer treatment and 24 in the historical control group) with iron deficiency anemia.
Eligibility criteria for Venofer treatment included patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, receiving erythropoietin, hemoglobin level between 8.0 and 11.0 g/dL, transferrin saturation &lt; 20%, and serum ferritin &lt; 300 ng/mL.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe mean age of the patients was 65 years with the age range of 31 to 85 years.
  HIGHLIGHTSOf the 77 patients, 44 (57%) were male and 33 (43%) were female.
 HIGHLIGHTS Venofer 100 mg was administered at 10 consecutive dialysis sessions either as slow injection or a slow infusion.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe historical control population consisted of 24 patients with similar ferritin levels as patients treated with Venofer, who were off intravenous iron for at least 2 weeks and who had received erythropoietin therapy with hematocrit averaging 31 to 36 for at least two months prior to study entry.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe mean age of patients in the historical control group was 56 years, with an age range of 29 to 80 years.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatient age and serum ferritin level were similar between treatment and historical control patients.
   HIGHLIGHTSPatients in the Venofer treated population showed a greater increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit than did patients in the historical control population.

 HIGHLIGHTSTransferrin saturation also increased at endpoint of study from baseline in the Venofer-treated population (8.8  1.6%) compared to this historical control population (-5.1  4.3%).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS 14.2 Study B: Hemodialysis Dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (HDD-CKD)  Study B was a multicenter, open label study of Venofer in 23 patients with iron deficiency and HDD-CKD who had been discontinued from iron dextran due to intolerance.
 HIGHLIGHTSEligibility criteria were otherwise identical to Study A.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe mean age of the patients in this study was 53 years, with ages ranging from 21 to 79 years.
  HIGHLIGHTSOf the 23 patients enrolled in the study, 10 (44%) were male and 13 (56%) were female.
    HIGHLIGHTSAll 23 enrolled patients were evaluated for efficacy.
  HIGHLIGHTSIncreases in mean hemoglobin (1.1 0.2 g/dL), hematocrit (3.6 0.6%), serum ferritin (266.3 30.3 ng/mL) and transferrin saturation (8.7 2.0%) were observed from baseline to end of treatment.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.3 Study C: Hemodialysis Dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (HDD-CKD)  Study C was a multicenter, open-label study in patients with HDD-CKD.
  HIGHLIGHTSThis study enrolled patients with a hemoglobin  &#x2030;  10 g/dL, a serum transferrin saturation  &#x2030;  20%, and a serum ferritin  &#x2030;  200 ng/mL, who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis 2 to 3 times weekly.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe mean age of the patients enrolled in this study was 41 years, with ages ranging from 16 to 70 years.
  HIGHLIGHTSOf 130 patients evaluated for efficacy in this study, 68 (52%) were male and 62 (48%) were female.
  HIGHLIGHTSForty-eight percent of the patients had previously been treated with oral iron.
 HIGHLIGHTSExclusion criteria were similar to those in studies A and B.
  HIGHLIGHTSVenofer was administered in doses of 100 mg during sequential dialysis sessions until a pre-determined (calculated) total dose of iron was administered.
 HIGHLIGHTSA 50 mg dose (2.5 mL) was given to patients within two weeks of study entry as a test dose.
  HIGHLIGHTSTwenty-seven patients (20%) were receiving erythropoietin treatment at study entry and they continued to receive the same erythropoietin dose for the duration of the study.
   HIGHLIGHTSThe modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population consisted of 131 patients.
  HIGHLIGHTSIncreases from baseline in mean hemoglobin (1.7 g/dL), hematocrit (5%), serum ferritin (434.6 ng/mL), and serum transferrin saturation (14%) were observed at week 2 of the observation period and these values remained increased at week 4 of the observation period.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.4 Study D: Non-Dialysis Dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (NDD-CKD) Study D was a randomized, open-label, multicenter, active-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of oral iron versus Venofer in patients with NDD-CKD with or without erythropoietin therapy.
Erythropoietin therapy was stable for 8 weeks prior to randomization.
  HIGHLIGHTSIn the study 188 patients with NDD-CKD, hemoglobin of  &#x2030;  11.0 g/dL, transferrin saturation  &#x2030;  25%, ferritin  &#x2030;  300 ng/mL were randomized to receive oral iron (325 mg ferrous sulfate three times daily for 56 days); or Venofer (either 200 mg over 2 to 5 minutes 5 times within 14 days or two 500 mg infusions on Day 1 and Day 14, administered over 3.5 to 4 hours).
  HIGHLIGHTSThe mean age of the 91 treated patients in the Venofer group was 61.6 years (range 25 to 86 years) and 64 years (range 21 to 86 years) for the 91 patients in the oral iron group.
    HIGHLIGHTSA statistically significantly greater proportion of Venofer subjects (35/79; 44.3%) compared to oral iron subjects (23/82; 28%) had an increase in hemoglobin  &#x2030;  1 g/dL at anytime during the study (p = 0.03).
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.5 Study E: Peritoneal Dialysis Dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (PDD-CKD) Study E was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study comparing patients with PDD-CKD receiving an erythropoietin and intravenous iron to patients with PDD-CKD receiving an erythropoietin alone without iron supplementation.
  HIGHLIGHTSPatients with PDD-CKD, stable erythropoietin for 8 weeks, hemoglobin of  &#x2030;  11.5 g/dL, TSAT  &#x2030;  25%, ferritin  &#x2030;  500 ng/mL were randomized to receive either no iron or Venofer (300 mg in 250 mL 0.9% NaCl over 1.5 hours on Day 1 and 15 and 400 mg in 250 mL 0.9% NaCl over 2.5 hours on Day 29).
  HIGHLIGHTSThe mean age of the 75 treated patients in the Venofer / erythropoietin group was 51.9 years (range 21 to 81 years) vs. 52.8 years (range 23 to 77 years) for 46 patients in the erythropoietin alone group.
    HIGHLIGHTSPatients in the Venofer / erythropoietin group had statistically significantly greater mean change from baseline to the highest hemoglobin value (1.3 g/dL), compared to subjects who received erythropoietin alone (0.6 g/dL) (p &lt; 0.01).
  HIGHLIGHTSA greater proportion of subjects treated with Venofer / erythropoietin (59.1 %) had an increase in hemoglobin of  &#x2030;  1 g/dL at any time during the study compared to the subjects who received erythropoietin only (33.3%).
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.6 Study F: Iron Maintenance Treatment Dosing in Pediatric Patients Ages 2 years and Older with Chronic Kidney Disease Study F was a randomized, open-label, dose-ranging study for iron maintenance treatment in pediatric patients with dialysis-dependent or non-dialysis-dependent CKD on stable erythropoietin therapy.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe study randomized patients to one of three doses of Venofer (0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg).
The mean age was 13 years (range 2 to 20 years).
  HIGHLIGHTSOver 70% of patients were 12 years or older in all three groups.
  HIGHLIGHTSThere were 84 males and 61 females.
 HIGHLIGHTSAbout 60% of patients underwent hemodialysis and 25% underwent peritoneal dialysis in all three dose groups.
At baseline, the mean hemoglobin was 12 g/dL, the mean TSAT was 33% and the mean ferritin was 300 ng/mL.
  HIGHLIGHTSPatients with HDD-CKD received Venofer once every other week for 6 doses.
  HIGHLIGHTSPatients with PDD-CKD or NDD-CKD received Venofer once every 4 weeks for 3 doses.
  HIGHLIGHTSAmong 131 evaluable patients with stable erythropoietin dosing, the proportion of patients who maintained hemoglobin between 10.5 g/dL and 14.0 g/dL during the 12-week treatment period was 58.7%, 46.7%, and 45.0% in the Venofer 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 2.0 mg/kg groups, respectively.
  HIGHLIGHTSA dose-response relationship was not demonstrated.
