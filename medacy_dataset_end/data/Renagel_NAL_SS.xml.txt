 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events
 HIGHLIGHTSCases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention.
  HIGHLIGHTSConsider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSCases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTSPatients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the Renagel clinical studies.
   HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.2 Monitor Serum Chemistries
 HIGHLIGHTSBicarbonate and chloride levels should be monitored.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.3 Monitor for Reduced Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels
 HIGHLIGHTSIn preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose.
  HIGHLIGHTSIn short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins.
  HIGHLIGHTSHowever, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39  22 ng/mL to 34 22 ng/mL (p&lt;0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment.
 HIGHLIGHTS Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials received vitamin supplements, which is typical of patients on dialysis.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
 HIGHLIGHTSBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug can not be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-control group (n=101).
  HIGHLIGHTSOverall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in &gt; 5% of patients included:  vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%).
 HIGHLIGHTSA total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSBased on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from Renagel was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3-16%).
 HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTSIn one hundred and forty-three peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks most adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control).
  HIGHLIGHTSThirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6.2 Postmarketing Experience
 HIGHLIGHTSThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel): pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation.
 HIGHLIGHTS Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications.
 HIGHLIGHTSBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTSThere are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Renvela and most concomitant oral drugs.
 HIGHLIGHTSFor oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
  HIGHLIGHTSThe duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product.
 HIGHLIGHTSWhere possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS8.1 Pregnancy
 HIGHLIGHTSPregnancy Category C: The effect of Renagel on the absorption of vitamins and other nutrients has not been studied in pregnant women.
 Requirements for vitamins and other nutrients are increased in pregnancy.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn pregnant rats given doses of Renagel during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred.
 In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of Renagel by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred.
[See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.2 Labor and Delivery
 HIGHLIGHTSNo Renagel treatment-related effects on labor and delivery were seen in animal studies.
HIGHLIGHTS The effects of Renagel on labor and delivery in humans are not known.
[See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.4 Pediatric Use
 HIGHLIGHTSThe safety and efficacy of Renagel has not been established in pediatric patients.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.5 Geriatric Use  Clinical studies of Renagel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
  HIGHLIGHTSOther reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
  HIGHLIGHTSIn general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS10.
OVERDOSAGE
 HIGHLIGHTSRenagel has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses of up to 14 grams per day for eight days with no adverse effects.
HIGHLIGHTSRenagel has been given in average doses up to 13 grams per day to hemodialysis patients.
  HIGHLIGHTSThere are no reports of overdosage with Renagel in patients.
 Since Renagel is not absorbed, the risk of systemic toxicity is low.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS11.
DESCRIPTION
HIGHLIGHTSThe active ingredient in Renagel Tablets is sevelamer hydrochloride, a polymeric aminethat binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration.
 HIGHLIGHTS Sevelamer hydrochloride ispoly(allylamine hydrochloride) crosslinked with epichlorohydrin in which forty percentof the amines are protonated.
 It is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N, &#x20ac;&#x2122;-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride.
 HIGHLIGHTS Sevelamer hydrochloride is hydrophilic,but insoluble in water.
  HIGHLIGHTSThe structure is represented in Figure 1.
       HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSFigure 1.
Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Hydrochloride
HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe primary amine groups shown in the structure are derived directly from poly(ally-lamine hydrochloride).
  HIGHLIGHTSThe crosslinking groups consist of two secondary amine groupsderived from poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and one molecule of epichlorohydrin.
  HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSRenagel Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of Renagel contains either 800 mg or 400mg of sevelamer hydrochloride on an anhydrous basis.
 HIGHLIGHTS The inactive ingredients arehypromellose, diacetylated monoglyceride, colloidal silicon dioxide, and stearic acid.
HIGHLIGHTSThe tablet imprint contains iron oxide black ink.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia.
 HIGHLIGHTSHigh serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification.
  HIGHLIGHTSWhen the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur.
  HIGHLIGHTSHyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTreatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis.
 HIGHLIGHTS Renagel taken with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with CKD who are on dialysis.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.1 Mechanism of Action
 HIGHLIGHTSRenagel contains sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-absorbed binding crosslinked polymer.
HIGHLIGHTSIt contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone.
 HIGHLIGHTS These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding.
HIGHLIGHTS By binding phosphate in the dietary tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer hydrochloride lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.2 Pharmacodynamics
 HIGHLIGHTSIn addition to effects on serum phosphate levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models.
HIGHLIGHTS Bile acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol.
HIGHLIGHTS Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%.
HIGHLIGHTSThis effect is observed after 2 weeks.
  HIGHLIGHTSTriglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.3 Pharmacokinetics
 HIGHLIGHTSA mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer hydrochloride in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed.
 HIGHLIGHTS No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSDrug Interactions In vivo
  HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTSSevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin.
Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSCo-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSConcomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSSevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSDuring postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine.
 HIGHLIGHTSReduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs.
 HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS13.
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTS13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 HIGHLIGHTSStandard lifetime carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats.
  HIGHLIGHTSRats were given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day.
 HIGHLIGHTSThere was an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g).
 HIGHLIGHTSMice received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose).
  HIGHLIGHTSThere was no increased incidence of tumors observed in mice.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural chromosome aberrations.
 HIGHLIGHTSSevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSSevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe highest dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid and high dose groups (human equivalent doses less than the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose).
 HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS14.
CLINICAL STUDIES
 HIGHLIGHTSThe ability of Renagel to lower serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was demonstrated in six clinical trials:  one double-blind placebo controlled 2-week study (Renagel N=24); two open-label uncontrolled 8-week studies (Renagel N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (Renagel N=256).
  HIGHLIGHTSThree of the active-controlled studies are described here.
 HIGHLIGHTSOne is a crossover study with two 8-week periods comparing Renagel to an active-control.
HIGHLIGHTSThe second is a 52-week parallel study comparing Renagel with active-control.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe third is a 12-week parallel study comparing Renagel and active-control in peritoneal dialysis patients.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.1 Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients
 HIGHLIGHTSEighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus &gt; 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period received Renagel and active-control for eight weeks each in random order.
 HIGHLIGHTSTreatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients started on treatment three times per day with meals.
 HIGHLIGHTSOver each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of Renagel could be titrated up 1 capsule or tablet per meal (3 per day) to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphate control.
 HIGHLIGHTSBoth treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 5).
