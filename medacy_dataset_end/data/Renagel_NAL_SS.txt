INDICATIONS AND USAGE
 RENAGEL (sevelamer hydrochloride) is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.
 The safety and efficacy of Renagel in CKD patients who are not on dialysis have not been studied.
 2.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
 Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binder.
 The recommended starting dose of Renagel is 800 to 1600 mg, which can be administered as one or two 800 mg Renagel Tablets or two to four 400 mg Renagel Tablets, with meals based on serum phosphorus level.
 Table 1 provides recommended starting doses of Renagel for patients not taking a phosphate binder.
 Table 1.
Starting Dose for Dialysis Patients Not Taking a Phosphate Binder
 Serum Phosphorus Renagel 800 mg Renagel 400 mg
 &gt; 5.5 and &lt; 7.5 mg/dL 1 tablet three times daily  with meals

 &#x2265; 9.0 mg/dL 2 tablets three times daily  with meals
 4 tablets three times daily  with meals
 Patients Switching From Calcium Acetate.
 In a study in 84 CKD patients on hemodialysis, a similar reduction in serum phosphorus was seen with equivalent doses (approximately mg for mg) of Renagel and calcium acetate.
 Table 2 gives recommended starting doses of Renagel based on a patient's current calcium acetate dose.
 Reference ID: 3664526
    Table 2.
Starting Dose for Dialysis Patients Switching From Calcium Acetate to Renagel

 1 tablet 1 tablet 2 tablets
 2 tablets 2 tablets 3 tablets
 3 tablets 3 tablets 5 tablets
 Dose Titration for All Patients Taking Renagel.
 Dosage should be adjusted based on the serum phosphorus concentration with a goal of lowering serum phosphorus to 5.5 mg/dL or less.
 The dose may be increased or decreased by one tablet per meal at two week intervals as necessary.
 Table 3 gives a dose titration guideline.
 The average dose in a Phase 3 trial designed to lower serum phosphorus to 5.0 mg/dL or less was approximately three Renagel 800 mg tablets per meal.
 The maximum average daily Renagel dose studied was 13 grams.

CONTRAINDICATIONS
  Renagel is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction.
 5.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events
 Cases of dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of the tablet formulation of sevelamer, some requiring hospitalization and intervention.
 Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders.
   Cases of bowel obstruction and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use.
   Reference ID: 3664526
    Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the Renagel clinical studies.
   5.2 Monitor Serum Chemistries
 Bicarbonate and chloride levels should be monitored.
 5.3 Monitor for Reduced Vitamins D, E, K (clotting factors) and Folic Acid Levels
 In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride reduced vitamins D, E, and K (coagulation parameters) and folic acid levels at doses of 6-10 times the recommended human dose.
 In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins.
 However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL) fell from 39  22 ng/mL to 34  22 ng/mL (p&lt;0.01) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment.
 Most (approximately 75%) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials received vitamin supplements, which is typical of patients on dialysis.
 6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug can not be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride (n=99) were similar to those reported for the active-control group (n=101).
 Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in &gt; 5% of patients included:  vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), flatulence (8%) and constipation (8%).
A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions.
  Based on studies of 8-52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from Renagel was gastrointestinal adverse reactions (3-16%).
 Reference ID: 3664526
    In one hundred and forty-three peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks most adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients.
 The most frequently occurring treatment emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis (8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active-control).
 Thirteen patients (14%) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients (20%) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis.
 6.2 Postmarketing Experience
 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel): pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, fecal impaction and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation.
 Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications.
 Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 7.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
 There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Renvela and most concomitant oral drugs.
For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate release or an extended release product.
Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.
   Reference ID: 3664526
    Table 4.
 Sevelamer Drug Interactions
 Oral drugs for which sevelamer did not alter the pharmacokinetics when administered concomitantly
 Digoxin Enalapril Iron Metoprolol Warfarin
 Oral drugs that have demonstrated interaction with sevelamer and are to be dosed separately from Renagel
  Ciprofloxacin Mycophenolate mofetil
  Dosing Recommendations Take at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after sevelamer Take at least 2 hours before sevelamer
 8.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C: The effect of Renagel on the absorption of vitamins and other
 nutrients has not been studied in pregnant women.
 Requirements for vitamins and other
 nutrients are increased in pregnancy.
In pregnant rats given doses of Renagel during
 organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones, probably due to a reduced
 absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred.
 In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of
 Renagel by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred.
[See
 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]
 8.2 Labor and Delivery
 No Renagel treatment-related effects on labor and delivery were seen in animal studies.
 The effects of Renagel on labor and delivery in humans are not known.
[See NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]
 8.4 Pediatric Use
 The safety and efficacy of Renagel has not been established in pediatric patients.
 8.5 Geriatric Use  Clinical studies of Renagel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and
 over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
 Other
 reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the
 Reference ID: 3664526
    elderly and younger patients.
 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be
 cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range.
 10.
OVERDOSAGE
 Renagel has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses of up to 14 grams per day for eight days with no adverse effects.
 Renagel has been given in average doses up to 13 grams per day to hemodialysis patients.
 There are no reports of overdosage with Renagel in patients.
 Since Renagel is not absorbed, the risk of systemic toxicity is low.
 Reference ID: 3664526
 11.
DESCRIPTION
The active ingredient in Renagel Tablets is sevelamer hydrochloride, a polymeric aminethat binds phosphate and is meant for oral administration.
 Sevelamer hydrochloride ispoly(allylamine hydrochloride) crosslinked with epichlorohydrin in which forty percentof the amines are protonated.
 It is known chemically as poly(allylamine-co-N,N&#x2019;-diallyl-1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) hydrochloride.
 Sevelamer hydrochloride is hydrophilic,but insoluble in water.
 The structure is represented in Figure 1.
      Figure 1.
Chemical Structure of Sevelamer Hydrochloride
The primary amine groups shown in the structure are derived directly from poly(ally-lamine hydrochloride).
 The crosslinking groups consist of two secondary amine groupsderived from poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and one molecule of epichlorohydrin.
 Renagel Tablets: Each film-coated tablet of Renagel contains either 800 mg or 400mg of sevelamer hydrochloride on an anhydrous basis.
 The inactive ingredients arehypromellose, diacetylated monoglyceride, colloidal silicon dioxide, and stearic acid.The tablet imprint contains iron oxide black ink.
  12.
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia.
 High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification.
 When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur.
 Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency.
 Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis.
 Renagel taken with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with CKD who are on dialysis.
 12.1 Mechanism of Action
 Renagel contains sevelamer hydrochloride, a non-absorbed binding crosslinked polymer.
 It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone.
 These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding.
 By binding phosphate in the dietary tract and decreasing absorption, sevelamer hydrochloride lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.
 12.2 Pharmacodynamics
 In addition to effects on serum phosphate levels, sevelamer hydrochloride has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models.
 Bile acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol.
 Because sevelamer binds bile acids, it may interfere with normal fat absorption and thus may reduce absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D and K.  In clinical trials of sevelamer hydrochloride, both the mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%.
 This effect is observed after 2 weeks.
 Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change.
 12.3 Pharmacokinetics
 A mass balance study using 14C-sevelamer hydrochloride in 16 healthy male and female volunteers showed that sevelamer hydrochloride is not systemically absorbed.
 No absorption studies have been performed in patients with renal disease.
 Drug Interactions
 In vivo
 Reference ID: 3664526
    Sevelamer carbonate has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (9.6 grams once daily with a meal) with warfarin and digoxin.
Sevelamer hydrochloride, which contains the same active moiety as sevelamer carbonate, has been studied in human drug-drug interaction studies (2.4-2.8 grams single dose or three times daily with meals or two times daily without meals) with ciprofloxacin, digoxin, enalapril, iron, metoprolol, mycophenolate mofetil and warfarin.
 Co-administered single dose of 2.8 grams of sevelamer hydrochloride in fasted state decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% in healthy subjects.
 Concomitant administration of sevelamer and mycophenolate mofetil in adult and pediatric patients decreased the mean MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 36% and 26% respectively.
 Sevelamer carbonate or sevelamer hydrochloride did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of enalapril, digoxin, iron, metoprolol and warfarin when co-administered.
 During postmarketing experience, cases of increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been reported in patients co-administered sevelamer hydrochloride and levothyroxine.
Reduction in concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus leading to dose increases has also been reported in transplant patients when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride without any clinical consequences (for example, graft rejection).
The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs.

    13.
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Standard lifetime carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats.
 Rats were
 given sevelamer hydrochloride by diet at 0.3, 1, or 3 g/kg/day.
There was an increased
 incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma in male rats of the high dose
 group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g).
 Mice
 received dietary administration of sevelamer hydrochloride at doses of up to 9 g/kg/day
 (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical trial dose).
 There was no
 increased incidence of tumors observed in mice.
 In an in vitro mammalian cytogenetic test with metabolic activation, sevelamer
 hydrochloride caused a statistically significant increase in the number of structural
 chromosome aberrations.
 Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames
 bacterial mutation assay.
 Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary
 administration study in which the females were treated from 14 days prior to mating
 through gestation and the males were treated for 28 days prior to mating.
 The highest
 dose in this study was 4.5 g/kg/day (human equivalent dose 3 times the maximum clinical
 trial dose of 13 g).
 In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 g/kg/day of sevelamer
 hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of fetal bones,
 probably due to a reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamin D, occurred in mid- and high-
dose groups (human equivalent doses less than the maximum clinical trial dose of 13 g).
  In pregnant rabbits given oral doses of 100, 500 or 1000 mg/kg/day of sevelamer
 hydrochloride by gavage during organogenesis, an increase of early resorptions occurred
 in the high-dose group (human equivalent dose twice the maximum clinical trial dose).
 Reference ID: 3664526
    14.
CLINICAL STUDIES
 The ability of Renagel to lower serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis was demonstrated in six clinical trials:  one double-blind placebo controlled 2-week study (Renagel N=24); two open-label uncontrolled 8-week studies (Renagel N=220) and three active-controlled open-label studies with treatment durations of 8 to 52 weeks (Renagel N=256).
 Three of the active-controlled studies are described here.
 One is a crossover study with two 8-week periods comparing Renagel to an active-control.
 The second is a 52-week parallel study comparing Renagel with active-control.
 The third is a 12-week parallel study comparing Renagel and active-control in peritoneal dialysis patients.
 14.1 Active-Control, Cross-Over Study in Hemodialysis Patients
 Eighty-four CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus &gt; 6.0 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period received Renagel and active-control for eight weeks each in random order.
 Treatment periods were separated by a two-week phosphate binder washout period.
 Patients started on treatment three times per day with meals.
 Over each eight-week treatment period, at three separate time points the dose of Renagel could be titrated up 1 capsule or tablet per meal (3 per day) to control serum phosphorus, the dose of active-control could also be altered to attain phosphate control.
 Both treatments significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus by about 2 mg/dL (Table 5).

                      Average daily Renagel dose at the end of treatment was 4.9 g (range of 0.0 to 12.6 g).
 14.2 Active-Control, Parallel Study in Hemodialysis Patients
 Two hundred CKD patients on hemodialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus &gt;5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive Renagel 800 mg tablets (N=99) or an active-control (N=101).
 The two treatments produced similar decreases in serum phosphorus.
 At week 52, using last-observation-carried-forward, Renagel and active-control both significantly decreased mean serum phosphorus (Table 6).

    Average daily Renagel dose at the end of treatment was 6.5 g (range of 0.8 to 13 g).
   14.3 Active-Control, Parallel Study in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients
 One hundred and forty-three patients on peritoneal dialysis who were hyperphosphatemic (serum phosphorus &gt; 5.5 mg/dL) following a two-week phosphate binder washout period were randomized to receive Renagel (N=97) or active-control (N=46) open label for 12 weeks.
 Average daily Renagel dose at the end of treatment was 5.9 g (range 0.8 to 14.3 g).
 There were statistically significant changes in serum phosphorus (p&lt;0.001) for Renagel (-1.6 mg/dL from baseline of 7.5 mg/dL), similar to the active-control.
