 WARNING: CHEMICAL ARACHNOIDITIS ADVERSE REACTIONS
 Chemical arachnoiditis, a syndrome manifested primarily by nausea, vomiting, headache and fever, was a
 common adverse event in all clinical studies.
If left untreated, chemical arachnoiditis may be fatal.
Patients
 receiving DepoCyt should be treated concurrently with dexamethasone to mitigate the symptoms of chemical  arachnoiditis.
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]
 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
 DepoCyt
 (cytarabine liposome injection) is indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous   meningitis.
  2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
 2.1 Preparation and Administration Precautions
 DepoCyt is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be
 used in handling DepoCyt.
The use of gloves is recommended.
If DepoCyt suspension contacts the skin,
 wash immediately with soap and water.
If it contacts mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water .
 2.2 Preparation and Administration
 No further reconstitution or dilution is required.
DepoCyt particles have a tendency to settle with time.
 Vials of DepoCyt should be allowed to warm to room temperature and gently agitated or inverted to re
suspend the particles immediately prior to withdrawal from the vial.
Avoid aggressive agitation.
 DepoCyt should be withdrawn from the vial immediately before administration.
DepoCyt is a single dose
 vial and does not contain any preservative.
DepoCyt should be used within 4 hours of withdrawal from the
 vial.
Unused portions of each vial should be discarded properly [see How Supplied/ Storage and Handling
 (16)].
Do not save any unused portions for later administration.
Do not mix DepoCyt with any other
 medications.
 2.3 Dosing Precautions
 In-line filters must not be used when administering DepoCyt.
DepoCyt is administered directly into the
 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an intraventricular reservoir or by direct injection into the lumbar sac.
 DepoCyt should be injected slowly over a period of 1-5 minutes.
Following drug administration by lumbar
 puncture, the patient should be instructed to lie flat for 1 hour.
Patients should be ob served by the physician
 for immediate toxic reactions.
 2.4 Dosing Regimen
 For the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, DepoCyt 50 mg (one vial of DepoCyt) is recommended to be
 given according to the following schedule:
 Induction therapy DepoCyt, 50 mg, administered intrathecally (intraventricular or lumbar  puncture) every 14 days for 2 doses (weeks 1 and 3).
 Consolidation therapy DepoCyt, 50 mg, administered intrathecally (intraventricular or lumbar  puncture) every 14 days for 3 doses (weeks 5, 7 and 9) followed by 1
 additional dose at week 13.
 Maintenance DepoCyt, 50 mg, administered intrathecally (intraventricular or lumbar  puncture) every 28 days for 4 doses (weeks 17, 21, 25 and 29).
 Patients should be started on dexamethasone 4 mg twice a day either by mouth or intravenously for 5 days
 beginning on the day of DepoCyt injection.
 If drug related neurotoxicity develops, the dose should be reduced to 25 mg.
If it persists, treatment with
 DepoCyt should be discontinued.

 Ready-to-use, single dose vial containing 50 mg/5 mL (10 mg/mL) of cytarabine liposome injection.
  4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
 DepoCyt
 (cytarabine liposome injection) is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to cytarabine or
 any component of the formulation, and in patients with active meningeal infection.
 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 5.1 Chemical Arachnoiditis
 Chemical arachnoiditis, a syndrome manifested primarily by nausea, vomiting, headache and fever, has been
 a common adverse event in all studies.
If chemical arachnoiditis is suspected, exclude other inflammatory,
 infectious, or neoplastic conditions.
If left untreated, chemical arachnoiditis may be fatal.
The incidence
 and severity of chemical arachnoiditis can be reduced by coadministration of dexamethasone.
Patients
 receiving DepoCyt should be treated concurrently with dexamethasone to mitigate the symptoms of
 chemical arachnoiditis [see Dosage and Administration (2)].
 Toxic effects may be related to a single dose or to cumulative administration.
Because toxic effects can
 occur at any time during therapy (although they are most likely to occur within 5 days of drug
 administration), patients receiving intrathecal therapy with DepoCyt should be monitored continuously for
 the development of neurotoxicity.
If patients develop neurotoxicity, reduce subsequent doses of DepoCyt.
If
 neurotoxicity persists, discontinue DepoCyt [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
 Hydrocephalus has also been reported, possibly precipitated by arachnoiditis.
 Arachnoiditis is an expected and well-documented side effect of both neoplastic meningitis and of
 intrathecal chemotherapy.
The incidence of severe and life-threatening arachnoiditis in patients receiving
 DepoCyt was 19% (48/257) in all patients and 30% (10/33) in patients with lymphomatous meningitis.
In
 the early dose-finding study, chemical arachnoiditis was observed in 100% of cycles without dexamethasone
 prophylaxis.
When concurrent dexamethasone was administered, chemical arachnoiditis was observed in
 33% of cycles.
 5.2 Neurotoxicity
 Intrathecal administration of cytarabine may cause myelopathy and other neurologic toxicity and can rarely
 lead to a permanent neurologic deficit.
Administration of intrathecal cytarabine in combination with other
 chemotherapeutic agents or with cranial/spinal irradiation may increase this risk of neurotoxicity.
 Blockage to CSF flow may result in increased free cytarabine concentrations in the CSF and an increased
 risk of neurotoxicity.
Therefore, as with any intrathecal cytotoxic therapy, consideration should be given to
 the need for assessment of CSF flow before treatment is started.
 Following intrathecal administration of DepoCyt, central nervous system toxicity, including persistent  extreme somnolence, hemiplegia, visual disturbances including blindness which may be total and
 permanent, deafness and cranial nerve palsies have been reported.
Symptoms and signs of peripheral  neuropathy, such as pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness, and impaired bowel and bladder control have
 also been observed.
In some cases, a combination of neurological signs and symptoms has been reported as
 Cauda Equina Syndrome.
 If patients develop neurotoxicity, reduce subsequent doses of DepoCyt or discontinue DepoCyt Headache,
 nausea, and fever are expected in early signs of neurotoxicity.
 5.3 Transient Elevations in CSF Protein and CSF White Blood Cells
 Transient elevations in CSF protein and white blood cell counts have been observed in patients following
 DepoCyt administration.
 5.4 Embryo-fetal Toxicity
 Cytarabine, the active component of DepoCyt, can cause fetal harm if a pregnant woman is exposed to the
 drug systemically.
The systemic exposure of cytarabine following intrathecal administration of DepoCyt is

Cytarabine was teratogenic in mice and rats.
Cytarabine was embryotoxic in mice when
 administered during the period of organogenesis.
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient
 becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to a fetus.

 * Hydrocephalus acquired, CSF pleocytosis and meningism occurred in &#x2264; 10% of all studied adult patients receiving DepoCyt or an active comparator
 During the clinical studies, 2 deaths related to DepoCyt were reported.
One patient at the 125 mg dose level
 died of encephalopathy 36 hours after receiving an intraventricular dose of DepoCyt.
This patient, however,
 was also receiving concomitant whole brain irradiation and had previously received intraventricular
 methotrexate.
The other patient received DepoCyt, 50 mg by the intraventricular route and developed focal  seizures progressing to status epilepticus.
This patient died approximately 8 weeks after the last dose of study
 medication.
In the controlled lymphoma study, the patient incidence of seizures was higher in the DepoCyt
 group (4/17, 23.5%) than in the cytarabine group (1/16, 6.3%).
The death of 1 additional patient was
 considered "possibly" related to DepoCyt.

 days after his second dose of DepoCyt.
 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
 No formal assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between DepoCyt and other agents have been
 conducted.
Concomitant administration of DepoCyt with other antineoplastic agents administered by the
 intrathecal route has not been studied.
With intrathecal cytarabine and other cytotoxic agents administered
 intrathecally, enhanced neurotoxicity has been associated with coadministration of drugs.
 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 8.1 Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]
 Risk Summary
 There are no studies assessing the reproductive toxicity of DepoCyt.
The systemic exposure of cytarabine
 following intrathecal administration of DepoCyt is negligible.
Cytarabine can cause fetal harm if a pregnant
 woman is exposed to the drug systemically.
Three anecdotal cases of major limb malformations have been
 reported in infants after their mothers received intravenous cytarabine, alone or in combination with other
 agents, during the first trimester.
Advise women of childbearing potential to avoid becoming pregnant
 while receiving DepoCyt.
 If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while
 taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential harm to a fetus.
 Animal Data
 Cytarabine was teratogenic in mice (cleft palate, phocomelia, deformed appendages, skeletal abnormalities)
 when doses &#x2265;2 mg/kg/day were administered IP during the period of organogenesis (about 0.2 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m
2 basis), and in rats (deformed appendages) when 20 mg/kg was
 administered as a single IP dose on day 12 of gestation (about 4 times the recommended human dose on a
 mg/m2
 basis).
Single IP doses of 50 mg/kg in rats (about 10 times the recommended human dose on a
 mg/m2
 basis) on day 14 of gestation reduced prenatal and postnatal brain size and permanent impairment of
  learning ability.
  Cytarabine was embryotoxic in mice when administered during the period of organogenesis.
  Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal weight at 0.5 mg/kg/day (about 0.05 times the
 recommended human dose on mg/m2 basis), and increased early and late resorptions and decreased live litter
  sizes at 8 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the recommended human dose on mg/m2
 basis).
  8.3 Nursing Mothers
 It is not known whether cytarabine is excreted in human milk following intrathecal DepoCyt administration.
 The systemic exposure to free cytarabine following intrathecal treatment with DepoCyt was negligible.
 Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in
 nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking
 into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
 8.4 Pediatric Use
 The safety and efficacy of DepoCyt in pediatric patients has not been established.
 8.6 Hepatic and Renal Impairment
 The effects of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DepoCyt have not been studied.
 10 OVERDOSAGE
 No overdosages with DepoCyt
 (cytarabine liposome injection) have been reported.
An overdose with
  DepoCyt may be associated with severe chemical arachnoiditis including encephalopathy.
In an early
  uncontrolled study without dexamethasone prophylaxis, single doses up to 125 mg were administered.
  There is no antidote for overdose of intrathecal DepoCyt or unencapsulated cytarabine released from DepoCyt.
 Exchange of CSF with isotonic saline has been carried out in a case of intrathecal overdose of free cytarabine,
  and such a procedure may be considered in the case of DepoCyt overdose.
Management of overdose should be
 directed at maintaining vital functions.

 DepoCyt
 (cytarabine liposome injection) is a sterile, injectable suspension of the antimetabolite cytarabine for
 intrathecal administration.
 The chemical name of cytarabine is 4-amino-1--D-arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)pyrimidinone and is also known as cytosine arabinoside.
It has a molecular formula of C9H13N3O5 and a
 molecular weight 243.22 g/mol.
Cytarabine has the following structural formula:
 DepoCyt is available as a single-dose vial containing 50 mg/5 mL (10 mg/mL) of cytarabine.
DepoCyt is
 formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, white to off-white suspension of cytarabine liposomes in 0.9% w/v
 sodium chloride in water for injection.
 Each mL contains 10 mg cytarabine, 4.4 mg cholesterol, 1.2 mg triolein,
 5.7 mg dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1.0 mg dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG).
DepoCyt
 is preservative-free.
The pH of the product falls within the range from 5.5 to 8.5.
 Liposome drug products may behave differently from nonliposome drug products.
Dep oCyt (cytarabine
 liposome injection) is not equivalent to, and cannot be substituted for, other drug products containing
 cytarabine.
 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 12.1 Mechanism of Action
 DepoCyt
 (cytarabine liposome injection) is a sustained-release formulation of the active ingredient
 cytarabine designed for direct administration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Cytarabine is a cell cycle
 phase-specific antineoplastic agent, affecting cells only during the S-phase of cell division.
Intracellularly,
 cytarabine is converted into cytarabine-5-triphosphate (ara-CTP), which is the active metabolite.
The
 mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it appears that ara -CTP acts primarily through
 inhibition of DNA polymerase.
Incorporation into DNA and RNA may also contribute to cytarabine
 cytotoxicity.
Cytarabine is cytotoxic to proliferating mammalian cells in culture.
 12.3 Pharmacokinetics
 Following intrathecal administration of DepoCyt 50 mg, peak levels of free CSF cytarabine were observed
 within 1 hour of dosing and ranged from 30 to 50 mcg/mL.
The terminal half-life for the free CSF
 cytarabine ranged from of 5.9 to 82.4 hours.
Systemic exposure to cytarabine was negligible following
 intrathecal administration of DepoCyt 50 mg.
 Metabolism and Elimination
 The primary route of elimination of cytarabine is metabolism to the inactive compound ara-U, followed by
 urinary excretion of ara-U. In contrast to systemically administered cytarabine, which is rapidly
 metabolized to ara-U, conversion to ara-U in the CSF is negligible after intrathecal administration because
 of the significantly lower cytidine deaminase activity in the CNS tissues and CSF.
The CSF clearance rate
 of cytarabine is similar to the CSF bulk flow rate of 0.24 mL/min.
 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility studies have been conducted with DepoCyt.
 Cytarabine was mutagenic in in vitro tests and was clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations and SCE
 in human leukocytes) and in vivo (chromosome aberrations and SCE assay in rodent bone marrow, mouse

Cytarabine caused the transformation of hamster embryo cells and rat H43 cells in
 vitro.
 No studies assessing the impact of cytarabine on fertility are available in the literature.
Cytarabine was
 clastogenic to meiotic cells; a dose-dependent increase in sperm-head abnormalities and chromosomal
 aberrations occurred in mice given IP cytarabine.
Because the systemic exposure to free cytarabine
 following intrathecal treatment with DepoCyt was negligible, the risk of impaired fertility after intrathecal
 DepoCyt is likely to be low.
 14 CLINICAL STUDIES
 DepoCyt (cytarabine liposome injection) was studied in 2 controlled clinical studies that enrolled patients
 with neoplastic meningitis.
 14.1 Study 1 - Solid Tumors, Lymphoma, or Leukemia
 The first study, which was a randomized, multi-center, multi-arm study involving a total of 99 treated
 patients, compared 50 mg of DepoCyt administered every 2 weeks to standard intrathecal chemotherapy
 administered twice a week to patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, or leukemia.
For patients with
 lymphoma, standard therapy consisted of 50 mg of unencapsulated cytarabine given twice a week.
Thirty-
three lymphoma patients (17 DepoCyt, 16 cytarabine) were treated.
Patients went off study if they had not
 achieved a complete response defined as clearing of the CSF from all previously positive sites in the
 absence of progression of neurological symptoms, after 4 weeks of treatment with study drug.
 In the first study, complete response was prospectively defined as (1) conversion, confirmed by a blinded
 central pathologist, from a positive examination of the CSF for malignant cells to a negative examination
 on two separate occasions (at least 3 days apart, on day 29 and later) at all initially positive sites, together
 with (2) an absence of neurological progression during the treatment period.
 The complete response rates in the first study of lymphoma are shown in Table 3.
Although there was a
 plan for central pathology review of the data, in 4 of the 7 responding patients on the DepoCyt arm this was
 not accomplished and these cases were considered to have had a complete response based on the reading of
 an unblinded pathologist.
The median overall survival of all treated patients was 99.5 days in the DepoCyt
 group and 63 days in the cytarabine group.
In both groups the majority of patients died from progressive
 systemic disease, not neoplastic meningitis.
 14.2 Study 2 - Lymphoma
 The second study was a randomized, multi-center, multi-arm study involving a total of 124 treated patients
 with either solid tumors or lymphomas.
In this study, 24 patients with lymphoma were randomized and
 treated with DepoCyt or cytarabine.
Patients received 6 two-week induction cycles of DepoCyt 50 mg
 every 2 weeks or cytarabine 50 mg twice weekly.
Patients then received four maintenance cycles of
 DepoCyt 50 mg every 4 weeks, or cytarabine 50 mg weekly for 4 weeks.
In both studies, patients received
 concurrent treatment with dexamethasone to minimize symptoms associated with chemical arachnoiditis
 [see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Dosage and Administration (2)].
In this study, cytological response
 was assessed in a blinded fashion utilizing a similar definition as in the first study.
The results in patients
 with lymphomatous meningitis are shown in Table 3.
