1WARNINGS: ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS,  AND TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE
 1Chronic Kidney Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 1In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL.
 1No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks.
 1Use the lowest Mircera dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
  1Cancer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
 1Mircera is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of anemia due to cancer chemotherapy.
1A dose-ranging study of Mircera was terminated early because of more deaths among patients receiving Mircera than another ESA.
1ESAs have shown shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies in patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers.
 1 11 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
 11.1  Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease
 1Mircera is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis.
 11.2 Limitations of Use
 1Mircera is not indicated and is not recommended:
 1In the treatment of anemia due to cancer chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
  1As a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia [see Clinical 13 Pharmacology (12.2)]
 1Mircera has not been shown to improve symptoms, physical functioning or health-related quality of life.
  1 12 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
12.1 Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors
1Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment and maintain iron repletion.
 1Correct or 19 exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Mircera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
  12.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
 1Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see 23 Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
1In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL.
1No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks.
1Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events 28 [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].
 1For all patients with CKD:
  1When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly.
1When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness  and hemoglobin variability.
1A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.
1Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks.
Decreases in dose can occur more frequently.
1Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
 1If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of Mircera by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
1For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
1For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the Mircera dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks.
1Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
1Evaluate other causes of anemia.
1Discontinue Mircera if responsiveness does not improve.
 1Mircera is administered either intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC).
1When administered SC, Mircera should be injected in the abdomen, arm or thigh.
  1For Patients with CKD on dialysis:
1Initiate Mircera treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
1If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Mircera.
1The recommended starting dose of Mircera for the treatment of anemia in adult CKD patients who are not currently treated with an ESA is 0.6 mcg/kg body weight administered as a single IV or SC injection once every two weeks.
1The IV route is recommended for patients receiving hemodialysis because the IV route may be less immunogenic [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
  1Once the hemoglobin has been stabilized, Mircera may be administered once monthly using a dose that is twice that of the every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary.
 1For Patients with CKD not on dialysis:
 1Consider initiating Mircera treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
1The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and,
1Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
1If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Mircera, and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
1The recommended starting dose of Mircera for the treatment of anemia in adult CKD patients who are not currently treated with an ESA is 0.6 mcg/kg body weight administered as a single IV or SC injection once every two weeks.
 1Once the hemoglobin has been stabilized, Mircera may be administered once monthly using a dose that is twice that of the every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary.
1Refer patients who self-administer Mircera to the Instructions for Use [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].
  1Conversion from Epoetin alfa or Darbepoetin alfa to Mircera in Patients with CKD Mircera can be administered once every two weeks or once monthly to patients whose hemoglobin has been stabilized by treatment with an ESA (see Table 1).
1The dose of Mircera, given as a single IV or SC injection, should be based on the total weekly ESA dose at the time of conversion.

  1  14 CONTRAINDICATIONS
 1Mircera is contraindicated in patients with:
 1Uncontrolled hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
 1Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) that begins after treatment with Mircera or other erythropoietin protein drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
 1History of serious or severe allergic reactions to Mircera (e.g. anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, skin rash, and urticaria).
 1  15 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 15.1 Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism
 1In controlled clinical trials of patients with CKD comparing higher hemoglobin targets (13 - 14 g/dL) to lower targets (9 - 11.3 g/dL), ESAs increased the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, thrombosis of hemodialysis vascular access, and other thromboembolic events in the higher target groups.
  1Using ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL increases the risk of serious adverse cardiovascular reactions and has not been shown to provide additional benefit [see Clinical Studies (14)].
1Use caution in patients with coexistent cardiovascular disease and stroke [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
1Patients with CKD and an insufficient hemoglobin response to ESA therapy may be at even greater risk for cardiovascular reactions and mortality than other patients.
1A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks.
 1In controlled clinical trials of patients with cancer, ESAs increased the risks for death and serious adverse cardiovascular reactions.
These adverse reactions included myocardial infarction and stroke.
1In controlled clinical trials, ESAs increased the risk of death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures.
  1The design and overall results of the 3 large trials comparing higher and lower hemoglobin targets are shown in Table 2 (Normal Hematocrit Study (NHS), Correction of Hemoglobin Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) and Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT)).

  1Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
 1NHS: A prospective, randomized, open-label study of 1265 patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis with documented evidence of congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease was designed to test the hypothesis that a higher target hematocrit (Hct) would result in improved outcomes compared with a lower target Hct.
 1In this study, patients were randomized to epoetin alfa treatment targeted to a maintenance hemoglobin of either 14 1 g/dL or 10 1 g/dL.
1The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings of higher mortality in the high hematocrit target group.
Higher mortality (35% vs. 29%) was observed for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL than for the patients randomized to a target hemoglobin of 10 g/dL.
For all-cause mortality, the HR=1.27; 95% CI (1.04, 1.54); p=0.018.
1The incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, vascular access thrombosis, and other thrombotic events was also higher in the group randomized to a target hemoglobin of 14 g/dL.
 1 1CHOIR: In a randomized prospective trial, 1432 patients with anemia due to CKD who were not undergoing dialysis were assigned to epoetin alfa treatment targeting a maintenance hemoglobin concentration of 13.5 g/dL or 11.3 g/dL.
1The trial was terminated early with adverse safety findings.
1A major cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for congestive heart failure) occurred among 125 (18%) of the 715 patients in the higher hemoglobin group compared to 97 (14%) among the 717 patients in the lower hemoglobin group (HR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.7 p=0.03).
1 1TREAT: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of 4038 patients with: CKD not on  dialysis (eGFR of 20 - 60 mL/min), anemia (hemoglobin levels  &#x2030;  11 g/dL), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients were randomized to receive either darbepoetin alfa treatment or a matching placebo.
1Placebo grou patients also received darbepoetin alfa when their hemoglobin levels were below 9 g/dL.
1The trial objectives were to demonstrate the benefit of darbepoetin alfa treatment of the anemia to a target hemoglobin level of 13 156 g/dL, when compared to a "placebo" group, by reducing the occurrence of either of two primary endpoints: (1) a composite cardiovascular endpoint of all-cause mortality or a specified cardiovascular event (myocardial ischemia, CHF, MI, and CVA) or (2) a composite renal endpoint of all-cause mortality or progression to end stage renal disease.
1The overall risks for each of the two primary endpoints (the cardiovascular composite and the renal composite) were not reduced with darbepoetin alfa treatment (see Table 2), but the risk of stroke was increased nearly two-fold in the darbepoetin alfa -treated group versus the placebo group:  annualized stroke rate 2.1% vs. 1.1%, respectively, HR 1.92; 95% CI:  1.38, 2.68; p &lt; 0.001.
The relative risk of stroke was particularly high in patients with a prior stroke:  annualized stroke rate 5.2% in the darbepoetin alfa-treated group and 1.9% in the placebo group, HR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.44, 6.54.
Also, among darbepoetin alfa-treated subjects with a past history of cancer, there were more deaths due to all causes and more deaths adjudicated as due to cancer, in comparison with the control group.
 1Patients with Cancer
1An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions, some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs.
1In a randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 1 in Table 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]) of 939  women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year.
1This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%).
1This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa.
1Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; 181 HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).
1 1Patients Having Surgery
 1Mircera is not approved for reduction of RBC transfusions in patients scheduled for surgical procedures.
 1An increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients receiving epoetin alfa undergoing surgical orthopedic procedures has been observed.
1In a randomized controlled study (referred to as the "SPINE" study), 681 adult patients, not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and undergoing spinal surgery, received epoetin alfa and standard of care (SOC) treatment, or SOC treatment alone.
1Preliminary analysis showed a higher incidence of DVT, determined by either Color Flow Duplex Imaging or by clinical symptoms, in the epoetin  alfa group [16 patients (4.7%)] compared to the SOC group [7 patients (2.1%)].
1In addition, 12 patients in the  epoetin alfa group and 7 patients in the SOC group had other thrombotic vascular events.
 1Increased mortality was observed in a randomized placebo-controlled study of epoetin alfa in adult patients who were undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (7 deaths in 126 patients randomized to epoetin alfa versus no deaths among 56 patients receiving placebo).
1Four of these deaths occurred during the period of study drug administration and all four deaths were associated with thrombotic events.
1 15.2 Increased Mortality and/or Increased Risk of Tumor Progression or Recurrence in Patients with Cancer
 1Mircera is not indicated and is not recommended for use in the treatment of anemia due to cancer chemotherapy.
1A dose-ranging trial of Mircera in 153 patients who were undergoing chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer was terminated prematurely because more deaths occurred among patients receiving Mircera than another ESA.
1ESAs resulted in decreased locoregional control/progression-free survival and/or overall survival (see Table 3).
1These findings were observed in studies of patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy (Studies 5 and 6), in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (Study 1) or lymphoid malignancy (Study 2), and in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or various malignancies who were not  receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Studies 7 and 8).

 1Mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) was significantly higher in the epoetin alfa arm.
1The most common investigator- attributed cause of death within the first 4 months was disease progression; 28 of 41 deaths in the epoetin alfa arm and 13 of 16 deaths in the placebo arm were attributed to disease progression.
 1Investigator assessed time to  tumor progression was not different between the two groups.
1Survival at 12 months was significantly lower in the epoetin alfa arm (70% vs. 76%, HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p=0.012).
1Cancer Study 2 was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo) study conducted in 344 anemic patients with lymphoid malignancy receiving chemotherapy.
 1With a median follow-up of 29 months,  overall mortality rates were significantly higher among patients randomized to darbepoetin alfa as compared to placebo (HR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.82).
 1Cancer Study 7 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized (epoetin alfa vs. placebo), double-blind study, in which patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving only palliative radiotherapy or no active therapy  were treated with epoetin alfa to achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL.
1Following an interim analysis of 70 of 300 patients planned, a significant difference in survival in favor of the patients on the placebo arm of the trial was observed (median survival 63 vs. 129 days; HR 1.84; p=0.04).
 1Cancer Study 8 was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized (darbepoetin alfa vs. placebo), 16-week study in 989 anemic patients with active malignant disease, neither receiving nor planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
1There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction in proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions.
 1The median survival was shorter in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (8 months) compared with the placebo group (10.8 months); HR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.57.
 1  19 Decreased progression-free survival and overall survival:
 1Cancer Study 3 (the "PREPARE" study) was a randomized controlled study in which darbepoetin alfa  was  administered to prevent anemia conducted in 733 women receiving neo-adjuvant breast cancer treatment.
 1 1A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years at which time the survival rate was lower (86% vs. 90%, HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.18) and relapse-free survival rate was lower (72% vs. 78%,  HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.79) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated arm compared to the control arm.
 1Cancer Study 4 (protocol GOG 191) was a randomized controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460  cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
1Patients were randomized to receive epoetin  alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g/dL or to transfusion support as needed.
1The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in thromboembolic events in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control (19% vs. 9%).
1Both local recurrence (21% vs. 20%) and distant recurrence (12% vs. 7%) were more  frequent in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control.
1Progression-free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (59% vs. 62%, HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.91).
1Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (61% vs. 71%, HR 1.28, 245 95% CI: 0.68, 2.42).
 1Cancer Study 5 (the     &#x201a;  &#x201c;    &#x201a;     study) was a randomized controlled study in 351 head and neck cancer  patients where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins of 14 and 15 g/dL for 248 women and men, respectively.
1Locoregional progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients 249 receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.14, p=0.0008) with a median of 406 days epoetin beta vs. 745  days placebo.
1Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.84; p=0.02).
 1Decreased locoregional control:
 1Cancer Study 6 (DAHANCA 10) was conducted in 522 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving radiation therapy randomized to darbepoetin alfa with radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone.
1An interim analysis on 484 patients demonstrated that locoregional control at 5 years was significantly shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.96; p=0.02).
Overall survival was shorter in patients receiving darbepoetin alfa (RR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.68; p=0.08).
 1 15.3 Hypertension
 1Mircera is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
 1In Mircera clinical studies, approximately 27% of patients with CKD, including patients on dialysis and patient not on dialysis, required intensification of antihypertensive therapy.
 1Hypertensive encephalopathy and/or  seizures have been observed in patients with CKD treated with Mircera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
 1Appropriately control hypertension prior to initiation of and during treatment with Mircera.
 1Reduce or withhold  Mircera if blood pressure becomes difficult to control.
 1Advise patients of the importance of compliance with antihypertensive therapy and dietary restrictions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].
 1 15.4 Seizures
 1Seizures have occurred in patients participating in Mircera clinical studies.
 1During the first several months following initiation of Mircera, monitor patients closely for premonitory neurologic symptoms.
Advise patients to contact their healthcare practitioner for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms, or change in seizure  frequency.
  1 15.5 Lack or Loss of Hemoglobin Response to Mircera
 1For lack or loss of hemoglobin response to Mircera, initiate a search for causative factors (e.g., iron deficiency, infection, inflammation, bleeding).
 1If typical causes of lack or loss of hemoglobin response are excluded, evaluate for PRCA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
 1In the absence of PRCA, follow dosing recommendations for management of patients with an insufficient response to Mircera therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
 1 15.6 Pure Red Cell Aplasia
 1Cases of PRCA and of severe anemia, with or without other cytopenias that arise following the development of neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin have been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with Mircera.
1This has been reported predominantly in patients with CKD receiving ESAs by SC administration.
 1PRCA was not observed in clinical studies of Mircera.
 1PRCA has also been reported in patients receiving ESAs for anemia related to hepatitis C treatment (an indication for which Mircera is not approved).
  1If severe anemia and low reticulocyte count develop during treatment with Mircera, withhold Mircera and  evaluate patients for neutralizing antibodies to erythropoietin [see
 1 1Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
1Serum samples should be obtained at least a month after the last Mircera administration to prevent interference of  Mircera with the assay.
 1Contact Roche at 1-888-835-2555 to perform assays for binding and neutralizing antibodies.
1Permanently discontinue Mircera in patients who develop PRCA following treatment with Mircera  or other erythropoietin protein drugs.
1Do not switch patients to other ESAs as antibodies may cross-react [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
 1 15.7 Serious Allergic Reactions
 1Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, tachycardia, pruritus skin rash, and urticaria have been reported in patients treated with Mircera.
1If a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs due to Mircera, immediately and permanently discontinue Mircera and administer appropriate therapy.
 1 15.8 Dialysis Management
 1Therapy with Mircera results in an increase in red blood cells and a decrease in plasma volume, which could reduce dialysis efficiency; patients may require adjustments in their dialysis prescription after initiation of Mircera.
 1Patients receiving Mircera may require increased anticoagulation with heparin to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis.
1 15.9 Laboratory Monitoring
1Evaluate transferrin saturation and serum ferritin prior to and during Mircera treatment.
1Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
 1The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.
 1Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.
1Thereafter, hemoglobin should be monitored at least monthly provided hemoglobin levels remain stable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2].
 1 16 ADVERSE REACTIONS
 1The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:
 1Increased Mortality, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 1Increased mortality and/or tumor progression in patients with cancer [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.2)]
 1Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
 1Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
 1Pure red cell aplasia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
 1Serious allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]
  1The most commonly reported adverse reactions in  &#x2030; 10% of patients were hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis.
1The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation in the Mircera clinical studies were: hypertension, coronary artery disease, anemia, concomitant termination of other CKD therapy and septic shock.
  1 16.1 Clinical Trials Experience
 1The data described below reflect exposure to Mircera in 2737 patients, including 1451 exposed for 6 months and 1144 exposed for greater than one year.
1Mircera was studied primarily in active-controlled studies (n=1789 327 received Mircera, and n=948 received another ESA) and in long-term follow up studies.
1The population was 18 328 to 92 years of age, 58% male, and the percentage of Caucasian, Black (including African Americans), Asian 329 and Hispanic patients were 73%, 20%, 5%, and 9%, respectively.
1Approximately 85% of the patients were 330 receiving dialysis.
Most patients received Mircera using dosing regimens of once every two or four weeks, administered SC or IV.
  1Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of Mircera cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
1Some of the adverse reactions reported are typically associated with CKD, or recognized complications of dialysis, and may not necessarily be attributable to Mircera therapy.
1Adverse reaction rates did not importantly differ between patients receiving Mircera or another ESA.
 1Table 4 summarizes the most frequent adverse reactions ( &#x2030;  5%) in patients treated with Mircera.

 1Serious hemorrhagic adverse reactions of all types occurred among 5% and 4% of 344 patients receiving Mircera or another ESA, respectively.
  1 16.2 Immunogenicity
 1As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity.
1Neutralizing antibodies to Mircera that cross-react with endogenous erythropoietin and other ESAs can result in PRCA or severe anemia (with or without other cytopenias) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
1Compared to SC administration, the IV route of administration may lessen the risk for development of antibodies to Mircera.
 1In 1789 patients treated with Mircera in clinical studies, antibody testing using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted at baseline and during treatment.
1Antibody development was not detected in any of the patients.
1The incidence of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.
1Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.
1For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Mircera with the incidence of antibodies to other ESAs may be misleading.
1 17 DRUG INTERACTIONS
 1No formal drug/drug interaction studies have been performed.
 1 18 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
18.1 Pregnancy: Category C
 1Risk Summary
 1There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Mircera should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
1Animal Data
 1When methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was administered subcutaneously to rats and rabbits during gestation, bone malformation was observed in both species at 50 mcg/kg once every three days.
1This effect was observed as missing caudal vertebrae resulting in a thread-like tail in one rat fetus, absent first digit metacarpal and phalanx on each forelimb resulting in absent polex in one rabbit fetus, and fused fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae centra in another rabbit fetus.
1Dose-related reduction in fetal weights was observed in both rats and rabbits.
1At doses 5 mcg/kg once every three days and higher, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta caused exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects in dams.
1Once-weekly doses of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta up to 50 mcg/kg/dose given to pregnant rats did not adversely affect pregnancy parameters, natural delivery or litter observations.
 1Increased deaths and significant reduction in the growth rate of the F1 generation were observed during lactation and early post weaning period.
1However, no remarkable effect on reflex, physical and cognitive development or reproductive performance was observed in F1 generation of any dose groups.
 1 18.3 Nursing Mothers
 1It is not known whether Mircera is excreted into human breast milk.
In one study in rats, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was excreted into maternal milk.
1Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Mircera is administered to a nursing woman.
 1 18.4 Pediatric Use
1The safety and efficacy of Mircera in pediatric patients have not been established.
1 18.5 Geriatric Use
 1Clinical studies of Mircera did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
1Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
1In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
 1 18.6 Hepatic Impairment
1In a study comparing 12 patients with severe (Child-Pugh Classification Grade C) hepatic impairment to 12 healthy volunteers, the single-dose pharmacokinetic disposition of Mircera was not altered in patients with hepatic impairment.
1No adjustment of the starting dose is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.
 1 110 OVERDOSAGE
 1Mircera overdosage can elevate hemoglobin levels above the desired level, which should be managed with discontinuation or reduction of Mircera dosage and/or with phlebotomy, as clinically indicated [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2)].
1Cases of severe hypertension have been observed following overdose with ESAs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
1   111 DESCRIPTION
 1Mircera, methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, is an ESA which differs from erythropoietin through formation of a chemical bond between either the N-terminal amino group or the amino group of any lysine present in erythropoietin, predominantly Lys52 and Lys45, and methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) butanoic acid (approximately 30,000 daltons).
1This results in a total molecular weight of approximately 60,000 daltons.
Mircera is formulated as a sterile, preservative-free protein solution for intravenous or subcutaneous  administration.
 1Injectable solutions of Mircera in prefilled syringes are formulated in an aqueous solution containing sodium phosphate, sodium sulphate, mannitol, methionine and poloxamer 188.
1The solution is clear, colorless to slightly yellowish and the pH is 6.2 0.2.
1 112 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
112.1 Mechanism of Action
 1Mircera is an erythropoietin receptor activator with greater activity in vivo as well as increased half-life, in contrast to erythropoietin.
 1A primary growth factor for erythroid development, erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia.
1In responding to hypoxia, erythropoietin interacts with erythroid progenitor cells to increase red cell production.
1Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with CKD and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anemia.
1 112.2 Pharmacodynamics
1Following a single-dose of Mircera in CKD patients, the onset of hemoglobin increase (defined as an increase &gt; 0.4 g/dL from baseline) was observed 7 to 15 days following initial dose administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
1 112.3 Pharmacokinetics
1The pharmacokinetics of Mircera were studied in anemic patients with CKD including patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis.
 1Mircera pharmacokinetics, based on population analyses, were not altered by age, gender, race, or the use of dialysis.
 1Following an IV administration of Mircera 0.4 mcg/kg body weight to CKD patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, the observed terminal half-life was 134 - 65 hours (mean SD), and the total systemic clearance was 427 0.49     0.18 mL/hr/kg.
 1Following a SC administration of Mircera 0.8 mcg/kg to CKD patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, the terminal half-life was 139 - 67 hours.
1The maximum serum concentrations of Mircera were observed 72 hours (median value) following the SC administration.
1The absolute bioavailability of Mircera after the SC administration was 62%.
 1In CKD patients receiving multiple Mircera doses, pharmacokinetics were studied after the first dose and on week 9 and week 19 or 21.
 1Multiple dosing was found to have no effect on clearance, volume of distribution or bioavailability of Mircera.
1Based on population analyses of the clinical studies, Mircera did not accumulate following administration every four weeks.
 1However, when Mircera was administered every 2 weeks, blood concentrations at steady state increased by 12%.
1A comparison of serum concentrations of Mircera measured before and after hemodialysis in 41 patients showed that hemodialysis did not alter serum concentrations.
1The single-dose pharmacokinetics of Mircera in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Classification Grade C) hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers were similar.
  1The site of SC injection (abdomen, arm or thigh) had no clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Mircera in healthy volunteers.
1  113 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 113.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 1 No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with Mircera.
1Methoxy polyethylene glycol- epoetin beta did not induce a proliferative response in either the erythropoietin receptor positive cell lines HepG2 and K562 or the erythropoietin receptor negative cell line RT112 in vitro.
1In addition, using a panel of human tissues, the in vitro binding of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was observed only in bone marrow progenitor cells.
 1When methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was administered subcutaneously to male and female rats prior to and during mating, reproductive performance, fertility, and sperm assessment parameters were not affected.
 1 114 CLINICAL STUDIES
 1Patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis:  ESA effects on rates of transfusion.
1In early clinical studies conducted in CKD patients on dialysis, ESAs have been shown to reduce the use of RBC transfusions.
1These studies enrolled patients with mean baseline hemoglobin levels of approximately 7.5 g/dL and ESAs were generally titrated to achieve a hemoglobin level of approximately 12 g/dL.
1Fewer transfusions were given during the ESA treatment period when compared to a pre-treatment interval.
1In NHS, the yearly transfusion rate was 51.5% in the lower hemoglobin group (10 g/dL) and 32.4% in the higher hemoglobin group (14 g/dL).
1Patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis:  ESA effects on rates of transfusion
1In TREAT, a randomized, double-blind trial of 4038 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes not on dialysis, a post-hoc analysis showed that the proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions was lower in patients  administered an ESA to target a hemoglobin of 13 g/dL compared to the control arm in which the ESA was administered intermittently if hemoglobin concentration decreased to less than 9 g/dL (15% versus 25%  respectively).
1In CHOIR, a randomized open-label study of 1432 patients with CKD not on dialysis, use of an ESA to target a higher (13.5 g/dL) versus lower (11.3 g/dL) hemoglobin goal did not reduce the use of RBC transfusions.
1In each trial, no benefits occurred for the cardiovascular or end-stage renal disease outcomes.
1In each trial, the potential benefit of ESA therapy was offset by worse cardiovascular safety outcomes resulting in an unfavorable benefit-risk profile [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
 1ESA effects on quality of life Mircera use has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being.
 1ESA effects on rates of death and other serious cardiac adverse events
 1Three randomized outcome trials (NHS, CHOIR and TREAT) have been conducted in patients with CKD using Epogen/PROCRIT/Aranesp to target higher vs. lower hemoglobin levels.
Though these trials were designed to establish a cardiovascular or renal benefit of targeting higher hemoglobin levels, in all 3 studies, patients randomized to the higher hemoglobin target experienced worse cardiovascular outcomes and showed no reduction in progression to ESRD.
1In each trial, the potential benefit of ESA therapy was offset by worse cardiovascular safety outcomes resulting in an unfavorable benefit-risk profile [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
1Other ESA trials
 1 1The efficacy and safety of Mircera were assessed in six open-label, multi-center clinical studies that randomized patients to either Mircera or a comparator ESA.
1Two studies evaluated anemic patients with CKD who were not treated with an ESA at baseline and four studies evaluated patients who were receiving an ESA for treatment of the anemia of CKD.
 1In all studies, patients were assessed as clinically stable at baseline and without evidence of infection or inflammation as determined by history and laboratory data, including C-reactive protein (CRP  &#x2030;  15 mg/L for study 1 and CRP  &#x2030;  30 mg/L for studies 2 to 6).
1A CRP value above the threshold led to the exclusion of no more than 3% of the screened patients.
1In the clinical studies, ESAs were administered to achieve specific hemoglobin levels (see Table 5 and Table 6).
 1Following stabilization of hemoglobin levels (12 g/dL), the median monthly Mircera dose was 150 mcg (range of 97 mcg to 270 mcg).
 1Patients Not Currently Treated with an ESA
 1 1In Study 1 patients who were not receiving dialysis were randomized to Mircera or darbepoetin alfa, administered for 28 weeks.
 1The starting dose of Mircera was 0.6 mcg/kg administered SC once every two 495 weeks and the starting dose of darbepoetin alfa was 0.45 mcg/kg administered SC once a week.
 1 1In Study 2, patients who were receiving dialysis were randomized to Mircera or another ESA (epoetin alfa or epoetin beta), administered for 24 weeks.
1The starting dose of Mircera was 0.4 mcg/kg administered IV once every two weeks and the starting dose of the comparator was administered IV three times a week, consistent with the product's recommended dose.
1 1In these studies, the observed median dose of Mircera once every two weeks over the course of the correction/evaluation period was 0.6 mcg/kg.
 1Table 5 provides the results of the two studies.

 1 1*Goal: hemoglobin increase of at least 1 g/dL and to a level of at least 11 g/dL without RBC transfusion; hemoglobin levels were to be maintained within the range of 11 to 13 g/dL.
 1Patients Currently Treated with an ESA
 1Four studies assessed the ability of Mircera to maintain hemoglobin concentrations among patients currently treated with other ESAs.
 1Patients were randomized to receive Mircera administrations either once every two weeks or once every four weeks, or to continue their current ESA dose and schedule.
1The initial Mircera dose was determined based on the patient's previous weekly ESA dose.
As shown in Table 6, treatment with Mircera  once every two weeks and once every four weeks maintained hemoglobin concentrations within the targeted 511 hemoglobin range (10 to 13.5 g/dL).
