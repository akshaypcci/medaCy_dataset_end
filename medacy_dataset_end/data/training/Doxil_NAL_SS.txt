  WARNING: CARDIOMYOPATHY and INFUSION-RELATED REACTIONS &#x2022;  DOXIL (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection) can cause myocardial damage, including
 congestive heart failure, as the total cumulative dose of doxorubicin HCl approaches 550 mg/m2.
In a clinical study of 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450-550 mg/m2 .
Prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones should be included in calculations of total cumulative dosage.
The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
 &#x2022;  Acute infusion-related reactions consisting of, but not limited to, flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest or throat, and/or hypotension occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors treated with DOXIL.
Serious, life-threatening and fatal infusion reactions have been reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Ovarian Cancer
 DOXIL is indicated for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy.
 1.2 AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma DOXIL is indicated for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in patients after failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy.
 1.3 Multiple Myeloma DOXIL, in combination with bortezomib, is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy.

 &#x2022; Avoid applying pressure to the site
 &#x2022; Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 min 4 times a day for 3 days
 &#x2022; If the extravasation is in an extremity, elevate the extremity
 2.7 Procedure for Proper Handling and Disposal Handle and dispose of DOXIL in accordance with recommendations for the handling and disposal of hazardous drugs.1
 If DOXIL comes into contact with skin or mucosa, immediately wash thoroughly with soap and water.
 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS DOXIL: doxorubicin HCl liposomal injection: single use vials contain 20mg/10 mL and 50mg/25mL doxorubicin HCl as a translucent, red liposomal dispersion.
 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DOXIL is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivit y reactions, including anaphylaxis, to doxorubicin HCl [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Cardiomyopathy
 Doxorubicin HCl can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure.
The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin HCl is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure.
The relationship between cumulative DOXIL dose and the risk of cardiac toxicity has not been determined.
 In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL, the risk of cardiotoxicity was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450-550 mg/m2 .
Cardiotoxicity was defined as &gt;20% decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a &gt;10% decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal.
Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiotoxicity.
 Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of DOXIL, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity.
Administer DOXIL to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk.

The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion.
Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL in Trial 4, 7% of patients experienced acute infusion-related reactions resulting in dose interruption.
All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles.
Across multiple studies of DOXIL monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors, 11% of patients had infusion-related reactions.
 Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment is available for immediate use prior to initiation of DOXIL.
Initiate DOXIL infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
In the event of an infusion-related reaction, temporarily stop the drug until resolution then resume at a reduced infusion rate.
Discontinue DOXIL infusion for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions.
 5.3 Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS) In Trial 4, the incidence of HFS was 51% of patients in the DOXIL arm and 0.9% of patients in the topotecan arm, including 24% Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in DOXIL-treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan-treated patients.
HFS or other skin toxicit y required discontinuation of DOXIL in 4.2% of patients.
 HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier.
Delay DOXIL for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
Discontinue DOXIL if HFS is severe and debilitating.
 5.4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported from post-marketing experience in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to DOXIL.
These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with DOXIL and up to 6 years after the last dose.
Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer.
 The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long-term use.

At doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose, DOXIL was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits.
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with DOXIL [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3)].
 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling.
 &#x2022; Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 &#x2022; Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
 &#x2022; Hand-Foot Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
 &#x2022; Secondary Oral Neoplasms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] The most common adverse reactions (&gt;20%) observed with DOXIL are asthenia, fatigue, fever, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, hand-foot syndrome, rash and neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia.
 6.1 Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates on other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
 The safety data reflect exposure to DOXIL in 1310 patients including: 239 patients with ovarian cancer, 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and 318 patients with multiple myeloma.
 The following tables present adverse reactions from clinical trials of single-agent DOXIL in ovarian cancer and AIDS-Related Kaposi's sarcoma.
 Patients With Ovarian Cancer The safety data described below are from Trial 4, which included 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL 50 mg/m2 once every 4 weeks for a minimum of four courses in a randomized, multicenter, open-label study.
In this trial, patients received DOXIL for a median number of 3.2 months (range 1 day to 25.8 months).
The median age of the patients is 60 years (range 27 to 87), with 91% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 3% Hispanic or Other.

 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with DOXIL.
 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy
 Risk Summary Based on findings in animals, DOXIL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
In animal reproduction studies, DOXIL was embryotoxic in rats and abortifacient in rabbits following intravenous administration during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose [see Data].
There are no available human data informing the drug-associated risk.
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.
 The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown.
However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2-4% and of miscarriage is 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.
 Data Animal Data DOXIL was embryotoxic at doses of 1 mg/kg/day in rats and was embryotoxic and abortifacient at 0.5 mg/kg/day in rabbits (both doses are about 0.12 times the recommended dose of 50 mg/m2 human dose on a mg/m2 basis).
Embryotoxicity was characterized by increased embryo-fetal deaths and reduced live litter sizes.
 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether DOXIL is present in human milk.
Because many drugs, including anthracyclines, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from DOXIL, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with DOXIL.

 DOXIL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with DOXIL.
 Males DOXIL may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic fetal abnormalities.
Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with DOXIL [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
 Infertility Females
 In females of reproductive potential, DOXIL may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea.
Premature menopause can occur with doxorubicin HCl.
Recovery of menses and ovulation is related to age at treatment.
 Males DOXIL may result in oligospermia, azoospermia, and permanent loss of fertility.
Sperm counts have been reported to return to normal levels in some men.
This may occur several years after the end of therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of DOXIL in pediatric patients have not been established.
 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of DOXIL conducted in patients with either epithelial ovarian cancer (Trial 4) or with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (Trial 5) did not contain sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
 In Trial 6, of 318 patients treated with DOXIL in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma, 37% were 65 years of age or older and 8% were 75 years of age or older.
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients.

 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters for total doxorubicin following a single dose of DOXIL infused over 30 minutes are presented in Table 8.

 DOXIL displayed linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 10 to 20 mg/m2.
Relative to DOXIL doses at or below 20 mg/m2, the pharmacokinetics of total doxorubicin following a 50 mg/m2 DOXIL dose are nonlinear.
At this dose, the elimination half-life of DOXIL is longer and the clearance lower compared to a 20 mg/m2 dose.
 Distribution: Direct measurement of liposomal doxorubicin shows that at least 90% of the drug (the assay used cannot quantify less than 5-10% free doxorubicin) remains liposome-encapsulated during circulation.
 In contrast to doxorubicin, which displays a large volume of distribution (range 700 to 1100 L/m2), the small steady state volume of distribution of liposomal doxorubicin suggests that DOXIL is largely confined to vascular fluid.
Doxorubicin becomes available after the liposomes are extravasated.
Plasma protein binding of DOXIL has not been determined; the plasma protein binding of doxorubicin is approximately 70%.
 Metabolism: Doxorubicinol, the major metabolite of doxorubicin, was detected at concentrations of 0.8 to 26.2 ng/mL in the plasma of patients who received 10 or 20 mg/m2 DOXIL.

Following administration of doxorubicin HCl, the plasma clearance of doxorubicin is 24 to 35 L/h/m2 .
 13 NON-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility
 Mutagenicity or carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with DOXIL, however doxorubicin was shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay, and clastogenic in multiple in vitro assays (CHO cell, V79 hamster cell, human lymphoblast, and SCE assays) and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.
The possible adverse effects on fertility in animals have not been adequately evaluated.
DOXIL resulted in mild to moderate ovarian and testicular atrophy in mice after administration of a single dose of 36 mg/kg (about 2 times the 50 mg/m2 human dose on a mg/m2 basis).
Decreased testicular weights and hypospermia were observed in rats after repeat doses &#x2265; 0.25 mg/kg/day (about 0.03 times the 50 mg/m2 human dose on a mg/m2 basis), and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a marked decrease in spermatogenesis were observed in dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg/kg/day (about 0.4 times the 50 mg/m2 human dose on a mg/m2 basis).
 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Ovarian Cancer
 DOXIL was studied in three open-label, single-arm, clinical studies of 176 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer (Trials 1, 2, and 3).
One hundred forty-five of these patients were refractory to both paclitaxel- and platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, defined as disease progression while on treatment or relapse within 6 months of completing treatment.
Patients received DOXIL at 50 mg/m2 every 3 or 4 weeks for 3-6+ cycles in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity or disease progression.
 The median age at diagnosis ranged from 52 to 64 years in the 3 studies, and the range was 22 to 85.
Most patients had International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (FIGO) stage III or IV disease (ranging from 83% to 93%).
Approximately one third of the patients had three or more prior lines of therapy (ranging from 22% to 33%).
 The primary outcome measure was confirmed response rate based on Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria for patients refractory to both paclitaxel- and a platinum-containing regimen.
Secondary efficacy parameters were time to response, duration of response, and time to progression.

 In a pooled analysis of Trials 1-3, the response rate for all patients refractory to paclitaxel and platinum agents was 13.8% (95% CI 8.1% to 19.3%).
The median time to progression was 15.9 weeks, the median time to response was 17.6 weeks, and the duration of response was 39.4 weeks.
 In Trial 4, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, trial in 474 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer after platinum-based chemotherapy, patients were randomized to receive either DOXIL 50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks (n=239) or topotecan 1.5 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks (n=235).
Patients were stratified according to platinum sensitivity (response to initial platinum-based therapy and a progression-free interval of greater than 6 months off treatment) and the presence of bulky disease (tumor mass greater than 5 cm in size).
The primary outcome measure was time to progression (TTP).
Other endpoints included overall survival and objective response rate.
 Of the 474 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 60 years (range 25 to 87), 90% were FIGO stage III and IV; 46% were platinum sensitive; and 45% had bulky disease.
 There was no statistically significant difference in TTP between the two arms.

 14.2 AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma DOXIL was studied in an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study at a dose of 20 mg/m2
 every 3 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (Trial 5).
 Data is described for a cohort of 77 patients retrospectively identified as having disease progression on prior systemic combination chemotherapy (at least two cycles of a regimen containing at least two of three treatments: bleomycin, vincristine or vinblastine, or doxorubicin) or as being intolerant to such therapy.
Forty-nine of the 77 (64%) patients had received prior doxorubicin HCl.
 The median time on study was 5.1 months (range 1 day to 15 months).
The median cumulative dose of DOXIL was 154 mg/m2 (range 20 to 620 mg/m2).
Among the 77 patients, mean age was 38 years (range 24 to 54); 87% were Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 4% Black, and 4% Asian/Other/Unknown; median CD4 count was 10 cells/mm3; ACTG staging criteria were 78% poor risk for tumor burden, 96% poor risk for immune system, and 58% poor risk for systemic illness at baseline; and mean Karnofsky status score was 74%.
All patients had cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions, 40% also had oral lesions, 26% pulmonar y lesions, and 14% had lesions of the stomach/intestine.

In one trial, 7 of 17 (40%) patients had a durable response (median duration not reached but was longer than 11.6 months).
In the second trial, 4 of 11 patients (40%) on a stable antiretroviral therapy demonstrated durable responses.
 14.3 Multiple Myeloma The efficacy of DOXIL in combination with bortezomib was evaluated in Trial 6, a randomized, open-label, international, multicenter study in 646 patients who had not previously received bortezomib and whose disease progressed during or after at least one prior therapy.
Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either DOXIL (30 mg/m2) administered IV on day 4 following bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 4 , 8 and 11) or bortezomib alone every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Patients who maintained a response were allowed to receive further treatment.
The median number of cycles in each treatment arm was 5 (range 1-18).
 The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients with multiple myeloma were similar between treatment arms (Table 12).

 The primary outcome measure was time to progression (TTP).
TTP was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progressive disease or death due to progressive disease.
The combination arm demonstrated significant improvement in TTP.
As the prespecified primary objective was achieved at the interim analysis, patients in the bortezomib monotherapy group were then allowed to receive the DOXIL + bortezomib combination.
Survival continued to be followed after the interim analysis and survival data are not mature at this time.
Efficacy results are as shown in Table 13 and Figure 1.
