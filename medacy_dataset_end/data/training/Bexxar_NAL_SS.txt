 299 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 300 None
 301 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 302 5.1 Serious Allergic Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis 303 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause severe, including fatal, allergic reactions 304 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.3)].
Premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine 305 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.4), and (2.8)].
Have medications for the treatment of 306 allergic reactions available for immediate use during administration.
Signs and symptoms of 307 severe allergic reactions may include fever, rigors or chills, sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, 308 bronchospasm, and nausea during or within 48 hours of infusion.
Immediately interrupt 309 BEXXAR infusions for severe reactions and provide appropriate medical and supportive care 310 measures.
Permanently, discontinue the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients who develop 311 serious allergic reactions.
312 313 5.2 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias 314 Patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen experienced severe (NCI CTC 315 grade 3-4) and prolonged neutropenia (63%), thrombocytopenia (53%), and anemia (29%) [see 316 Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
The time to nadir was 4 to 7 weeks and the duration of cytopenias was 317 approximately 30 days.
Due to the variable nature of the onset of cytopenias, monitor patients 318 with weekly complete blood counts for up to 12 weeks.
319 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should not be administered to patients with &gt;25% 320 lymphoma marrow involvement, platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3, or neutrophil count 321 &lt;1,500 cells/mm3.
322 323 5.3 Radiation Exposure 324 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen contains Iodine-131.
Follow institutional radiation 325 safety practices and applicable federal guidelines to minimize radiation exposure during handling 326 and after administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
Advise patients of the risks of 327 radiation exposure of household contacts, pregnant women, and small children and of the steps to 328 be taken to reduce these risks.
 11
  Reference ID: 3174958
                               The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should be administered only by physicians enrolled in the certification program for dose calculation and administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
Further information regarding the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen certification program is available by phone at 1-877-423-9927.
 5.4 Secondary Malignancies Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia may occur with the use of the
 BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 10% of patients enrolled in clinical trials and 3% of patients enrolled in the expanded access program (median follow-up of 39 and 27 months, respectively).
The median time to development of MDS or leukemia was 31 months [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 Non-hematologic malignancies may occur with the use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 5% of patients enrolled in clinical trials or the expanded access program.
In the absence of controlled studies, the relative risk of secondary malignancies in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen cannot be determined [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 5.5 Hypothyroidism The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions
 (6.1)].
Initiate thyroid-blocking medications at least 24 hours before administering the dosimetric dose and continue until 14 days after the therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
The risk of hypothyroidism is likely to be increased in patients who do not complete the recommended thyroid-protective regimen.
Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level before treatment and annually thereafter.
 5.6 Embryo-fetal Toxicity The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant
 woman including severe, and possibly irreversible, neonatal hypothyroidism.
Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus.
Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen during pregnancy for hypothyroidism at time of delivery and during the neonatal period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
 Males and females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after the therapeutic dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
 5.7 Excessive Radiation Exposure in Patients With Impaired Renal Function There are no data regarding the safety of administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic
 regimen in patients with impaired renal function.
Since the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is primarily cleared through the kidneys, the rate of excretion of radiolabeled iodine is expected to
 12
  Reference ID: 3174958
                                       13
  369 be decreased in patients with impaired renal function or obstructive uropathy, which may result 370 in increased patient exposure to I-131 tositumomab.
[See Use in Specific Populations (8.6), 371 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 372 373 5.8 Immunization 374 The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following administration of the 375 BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and the ability of patients who have received the BEXXAR 376 therapeutic regimen to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response to any vaccine have 377 not been studied.
Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients recently treated with 378 BEXXAR.
 379 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 380 The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of 381 the label: 382 &#x2022; Serious Allergic Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings 383 and Precautions (5.1) 384 &#x2022; Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 385 &#x2022; Secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] 386 &#x2022; Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] 387 The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic 388 regimen (per-patient incidence greater than 25%) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, 389 infections (including pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections), 390 infusion reactions, asthenia, fever, and nausea [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions 391 (5.1, 5.2)].
392 The most common serious adverse reactions in patients receiving the BEXXAR 393 therapeutic regimen were severe and prolonged cytopenias, infections (including pneumonia, 394 bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections), serious allergic reactions (including 395 bronchospasm and angioedema), infusion reactions, and secondary leukemia and 396 myelodysplastic syndrome [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
397 398 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience 399 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 400 rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical 401 trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
402 The reported safety data reflects exposure to the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in 230 403 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in 5 clinical trials using the recommended dose 404 and schedule.
Patients were followed for a median of 39 months; 79% were followed for at least 405 12 months for survival and selected adverse reactions.
Patients had a median of 3 prior 406 chemotherapy regimens, a median age of 55 years, and 60% were male.
Twenty-seven percent 407 (27%) had transformation to a higher grade histology; 29% had intermediate-grade histology,
 Reference ID: 3174958
                      408 and 2% had high-grade histology (IWF); 68% had Ann Arbor stage IV disease.
Patients enrolled 409 in these studies were not permitted to have prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or 410 irradiation to more than 25% of the marrow space.
411 Data on serious adverse reactions and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and TSH 412 levels were obtained from an additional 765 patients enrolled in the expanded access program 413 and used to supplement the characterization of delayed adverse reactions.
Patients in the 414 expanded access program had fewer prior chemotherapy regimens (2 versus 3) and a higher 415 proportion had low-grade histology (77% versus 70%) compared to patients in clinical trials.

428 c Grade 4 toxicity was assumed if patient had documented Grade 3 toxicity and was missing 2 429 or more weeks of hematology data between Week 5 and Week 9.
430 431 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias: The incidence and duration of severe cytopenias are 432 shown in Table 3.
Sixty-three (27%) patients received one or more hematologic supportive care 433 measures following the therapeutic dose including G-CSF, epoetin alfa, platelet transfusions, and 434 packed red blood cell transfusions.
Twenty-eight (12%) patients experienced hemorrhagic 435 adverse reactions.
436 Infections: One hundred and four patients (45%) patients experienced one or more 437 infections.
Twenty (9%) experienced serious infections including pneumonia, bacteremia, 438 septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections.
439 Allergic (Hypersensitivity) Reactions: Fourteen patients (6%) experienced one or more of 440 the following adverse reactions: allergic reaction, facial edema, injection site hypersensitivity, 441 anaphylactic reaction, laryngismus, and serum sickness.
442 Infusion-related Adverse Reactions: Infusion reactions including fever, rigors or chills, 443 sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea occurred during or within 48 hours

  444 of infusion.
Sixty-seven patients (29%) experienced fever, rigors/chills, or sweating within 14 445 days following the dosimetric dose.
All patients in the clinical studies received pretreatment with 446 acetaminophen and an antihistamine.
 447 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Secondary Leukemia: The incidence of 448 MDS/secondary leukemia among the 230 patients included in the clinical studies was 10% 449 (24/230), with a median follow-up of 39 months and a median time to development of 34 450 months.
The cumulative incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia was 4.7% at 2 years and 15% at 451 5 years.
The incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia among the 765 patients in the expanded 452 access program was 3% (20/765), with a median follow-up of 27 months and a median time to 453 development of 31 months.
The cumulative incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia in this patient 454 population was 1.6% at 2 years and 6% at 5 years.
455 Secondary Malignancies: Of the 995 patients in clinical studies and the expanded access 456 programs, there were 65 secondary malignancies reported in 54 patients (5%) in clinical studies 457 and the expanded access program.
These included non-melanoma skin cancers (26), colorectal 458 cancer (7), head and neck cancer (6), breast cancer (5), lung cancer (4), bladder cancer (4), 459 melanoma (3), and gastric cancer (2).
 460 Hypothyroidism: Of the 230 patients in the clinical studies, 203 patients did not have 461 elevated TSH at study entry.
Of these, 137 patients had at least one post-treatment TSH value 462 available and were not taking thyroid hormonal treatment at study entry.
With a median follow463 up period of 46 months, the incidence of hypothyroidism (elevated TSH or initiation of thyroid 464 replacement therapy) was 18% with a median time to development of 16 months.
The 465 cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism at 2 and 5 years in these 137 patients were 11% and 466 19%, respectively.
Onset of hypothyroidism has occurred up to 90 months post-treatment.
The 467 cumulative incidence and median time to development of hypothyroidism were similar in the 468 expanded access program.
469 470 6.2 Immunogenicity 471 There is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins such as tositumomab.
472 Serum samples from 989 chemotherapy-relapsed or refractory patients included in the clinical 473 studies or the expanded access program were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 474 (ELISA) that detects antibodies to the Fc portion of IgG1 murine immunoglobulin.
One percent 475 of the patients (11/989) had a positive serology for HAMA prior to treatment.
The post-treatment 476 incidence of HAMA seropositivity is summarized in Table 4.
477
 Reference ID: 3174958
                                 478 Table 4.
Incidence of HAMA Seropositivity Among Patients With Chemotherapy-479 refractory or Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Receiving the BEXXAR Therapeutic 480 Regimen
 Chemotherapy- Percent Kaplan-Meier estimate of HAMA positivity  refractory or relapsed patients
 HAMA positive 6 months 12 months 18 months
 In clinical trials 23/219 (11%) 6% 17% 21% In expanded-access program 57/569 (10%) 7% 12% 13%
 481 482 In a study of 76 previously untreated patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 483 who received the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, the incidence of conversion to HAMA 484 seropositivity was 70%, with a median time to development of 27 days.
485 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay 486 sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, 487 concomitant medications, and underlying disease.
For these reasons, comparison of incidence of 488 antibodies to BEXXAR with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
489 490 6.3 Postmarketing Experience 491 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the 492 BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a 493 population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 494 establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
495 Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including fatal anaphylaxis.
496 Nervous system disorders: Axonal neuropathy leading to quadriparesis.
 497 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 498 No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tositumomab or I-131 499 tositumomab.
 500 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 501 8.1 Pregnancy 502 Pregnancy: Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]: There are no studies of 503 the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in pregnant women or animals.
Based on the transplacental 504 passage of I-131, administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to a pregnant woman can 505 cause fetal harm including severe and possibly irreversible neonatal hypothyroidism.
Limited 506 data suggest an increased risk of miscarriage up to a year following I-131 treatment.
507 Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic 508 regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus.
Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the 509 BEXXAR therapeutic regimen for hypothyroidism at the time of delivery and during the 510 neonatal period.

  Reference ID: 3174958
                                511 512 8.3 Nursing Mothers 513 Because immunoglobulins are secreted in human milk, it is expected that tositumomab 514 would be present in human milk.
Radiolabeled iodine is excreted in breast milk and may reach 515 concentrations equal to or greater than maternal plasma concentrations.
Because of the potential 516 for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, advise 517 women to discontinue nursing or to consider alternative treatment, taking into account the 518 importance of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to the mother.
519 520 8.4 Pediatric Use 521 The safety and effectiveness of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen have not been 522 established in children.
523 524 8.5 Geriatric Use 525 Clinical studies of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen did not include sufficient numbers 526 of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger 527 subjects.
528 529 8.6 Renal Impairment 530 Use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen has not been studied in patients with renal 531 impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
532 533 8.7 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential 534 Contraception: Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception 535 during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after treatment ends 536 to avoid the embryo-fetal effects of the radioisotope and the risk of increased pregnancy loss 537 during that time period.
 538 539 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen exposes the testes to radiation [see Dosage and 540 Administration (2.9)].
Because of the potential for mutagenesis in male gametes, males of 541 reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR 542 therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after treatment ends.
543 544 Infertility: The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen results in radiation exposure of the ovaries 545 and testes.
Based on published studies examining patients treated with I-131, the BEXXAR 546 therapeutic regimen may cause transient ovarian or testicular dysfunction.
Radiation effects may 547 persist for up to 12 months following treatment.

                            548 10 OVERDOSAGE
 549 The maximum radiation activity of the I-131 component of the BEXXAR therapeutic 550 regimen, administered to 4 patients, were doses calculated to deliver between 85 cGy and 88 cGy 551 total body irradiation.
The incidence of NCI Grade 4 cytopenias was increased in these 4 patients 552 compared to patients who received the recommended therapeutic dose for the BEXXAR 553 therapeutic regimen.
 554 11 DESCRIPTION 555 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is composed of the monoclonal antibody 556 tositumomab, and the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, I-131 tositumomab.
557 Tositumomab is a murine IgG2a lambda monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 558 antigen, produced in mammalian cells.
The approximate molecular weight of tositumomab is 150 559 kD.
560 Tositumomab is supplied as a sterile, pyrogen-free, clear to opalescent, colorless to 561 slightly yellow, preservative-free solution that must be diluted before intravenous administration.
562 The formulation contains 100 mg/mL maltose, 8.5 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1 mg/mL phosphate, 563 1 mg/mL potassium hydroxide, and Water for Injection, USP.
The pH is approximately 7.2.
564 I-131 tositumomab is tositumomab covalently linked to Iodine-131.
I-131 tositumomab is 565 supplied as a sterile, clear, preservative-free liquid.
The formulation for I-131 tositumomab 566 contains 0.9 to 1.3 mg/mL ascorbic acid, 1 to 2 mg/mL maltose (dosimetric dose) or 9 to 15 567 mg/mL maltose (therapeutic dose), 4.4% to 6.6% (w/v) povidone, and 8.5 to 9.5 mg/mL sodium 568 chloride.
The pH is approximately 7.0.
569 570 Physical/Radiochemical Characteristics of Iodine-131: Iodine-131 decays with beta and 571 gamma emissions with a physical half-life of 8.04 days.
The principal beta emission has a mean 572 energy of 191.6 keV, and the principal gamma emission has energy of 364.5 keV.
573 External Radiation: The specific gamma ray constant for Iodine-131 is 2.2 R/millicurie 574 hour at 1 cm.
Use a 2.55 cm thickness of Pb (to attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of 575 about 1,000) to minimize radiation exposure from this radionuclide.
576 The fraction of Iodine-131 radioactivity that remains in the vial x days after the date of 577 calibration is 2-(x/8.04).

 583 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 584 12.1 Mechanism of Action 585 Tositumomab binds specifically to an epitope within the extracellular domain of the 586 CD20 molecule.
The CD20 molecule is expressed on normal B lymphocytes (pre-B lymphocytes 587 to mature B lymphocytes) and on B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
The CD20 molecule is not 588 shed from the cell surface and is not internalized following antibody binding.
The BEXXAR 589 therapeutic regimen induces cell death by emitting ionizing radiation to CD20-expressing 590 lymphocytes or neighboring cells.
In addition to cell death mediated by the radioisotope, other 591 possible mechanisms of action include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement592 dependent cytotoxicity, and CD20-mediated apoptosis.
593 594 12.2 Pharmacodynamics 595 In two clinical studies (one in chemotherapy-naive patients and one in heavily pretreated 596 patients), the administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen resulted in sustained depletion 597 of circulating CD20-positive cells.
The assessment of circulating lymphocytes in these patients 598 did not distinguish normal from malignant cells; consequently, recovery of normal B cell 599 numbers was not directly assessed.
At 7 weeks following treatment, the median number of 600 circulating CD20-positive cells was zero (range: 0 to 490 cells/mm3) with recovery beginning at 601 approximately 12 weeks.
At 6 months following treatment, 8 (14%) of 58 chemotherapy-naive
 21
  Reference ID: 3174958
                   22
  602 patients and 6 (32%) of 19 heavily pretreated patients had CD20-positive cell counts below 603 normal limits.
There was no consistent effect of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen on post604 treatment serum IgG, IgA, or IgM levels.
605 606 12.3 Pharmacokinetics 607 A pharmacokinetic study of I-131 tositumomab determined that a 475-mg predose of 608 unlabeled antibody decreased splenic targeting and increased the terminal half-life of the 609 radiolabeled antibody.
The median blood clearance following administration of 485 mg of 610 tositumomab in 110 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was 68.2 mg/hr (range: 30.2 to 611 260.8 mg/hr).
Patients with high tumor burden, splenomegaly, or bone marrow involvement were 612 noted to have a larger volume of distribution, faster clearance, and shorter terminal half-life.
The 613 total body clearance, as measured by total body gamma camera counts, was dependent on the 614 same factors noted for blood clearance.
Patient-specific dosing, based on total body clearance, 615 provided a consistent radiation dose despite variable pharmacokinetics, by allowing each 616 patient's administered activity to be adjusted for individual patient variables.
The median total 617 body effective half-life, as measured by total body gamma camera counts, in 980 patients with 618 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 67 hours (range: 28 to 115 hours).
619 Elimination of Iodine-131 occurs by decay (Table 5) and excretion in the urine.
Five days 620 following the dose, the whole body clearance was 67% of the injected dose.
Ninety-eight percent 621 (98%) of the clearance was accounted for in the urine.
 622 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 623 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 624 No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic or 625 mutagenic potential of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen or to determine its effects on fertility 626 in males or females.
However, Iodine I-131 is a potential carcinogen and mutagen.
 627 Administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen exposes the testes and ovaries to 628 radiation [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)].
 629 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 630 The clinical benefit of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen was established in a single-arm 631 clinical trial conducted in 40 patients with low-grade, transformed low-grade, or follicular large632 cell lymphoma.
Patients had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60%, a granulocyte count 633 of 1500 cells/mm3, a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3, less than or equal to 634 25% of the intra-trabecular marrow space involved by lymphoma, and no evidence of 635 progressive disease arising in a field irradiated with &gt;3500 cGy within one year of completion of 636 irradiation.
637 This study enrolled 40 patients with low-grade or transformed low-grade or follicular 638 large-cell lymphoma whose disease had not responded to, or had progressed following, at least 4 639 doses of rituximab therapy.
The median age was 57 years (range: 35 to 78 years); the median 640 time from diagnosis to protocol entry was 50 months (range: 12 to 170 months); and the median
 Reference ID: 3174958
                                  641 number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4 (range: 1 to 11).
Overall, 35 of the 40 patients 642 were rituximab-refractory (defined as no response or a response of less than 6 months' duration 643 following rituximab therapy).
644 The main outcome measure was overall response rate as determined by an independent 645 panel that reviewed patient records and radiologic studies (Table 6).

 652 The results of this study were supported by demonstration of durable objective responses
 653 in 4 single-arm studies enrolling 190 patients evaluable for efficacy with rituximab-naive,
 654 follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with or without transformation, who had relapsed following
 655 or were refractory to chemotherapy.
In these studies, the overall response rates ranged from 47%
 656 to 64% and the median durations of response ranged from 12 to 18 months.
