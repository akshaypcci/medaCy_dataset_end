  1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
 SOMAVERT is indicated for the treatment of acromegaly in patients who have had an inadequate response to surgery or radiation therapy, or for whom these therapies are not appropriate.
The goal of treatment is to normalize serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels.
 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
 2.1 Dosage Information The recommended loading dose of SOMAVERT is 40 mg given subcutaneously, under healthcare provider supervision.
Provide proper training in subcutaneous injection technique to patients or their caregivers so they can receive once daily subcutaneous injections.
On the next day following the loading dose, instruct patients or their caregivers to begin daily subcutaneous injections of 10 mg of SOMAVERT.
 Titrate the dosage to normalize serum IGF-I concentrations (serum IGF-I concentrations should be measured every four to six weeks).
 The dosage should not be based on growth hormone (GH) concentrations or signs and symptoms of acromegaly.
 It is unknown whether patients who remain symptomatic while achieving normalized IGF-I concentrations would benefit from increased SOMAVERT dosage.
 &#x2022;  Increase the dosage by 5 mg increments every 4-6 weeks if IGF-I concentrations are elevated.
 &#x2022;  Decrease the dosage by 5 mg decrements every 4-6 weeks if IGF-I concentrations are below the normal range.
 The recommended dosage range is between 10 to 30 mg given subcutaneously once daily and the maximum daily dosage is 30 mg given subcutaneously once daily.
 2.2 Assess Liver Tests Prior to Initiation of SOMAVERT
 Prior to the start of SOMAVERT, patients should have an assessment of baseline levels of liver tests [serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)].
For recommendations regarding initiation of SOMAVERT based on baseline liver tests and recommendations for monitoring of liver tests while on SOMAVERT, refer to Table 1 in Warning and Precautions (5.2).
 2.3 Loading Dose Injection Procedure The following instructions are for the healthcare provider to reconstitute and prepare the 40 mg loading dose.
 The healthcare provider will need to reconstitute 1 vial of lyophilized powder of SOMAVERT containing 20 mg of pegvisomant with supplied diluent (two vials of lyophilized powder and two vials of diluet will be needed for the 40 mg loading dose).
The healthcare provider will also need to inject the reconstituted SOMAVERT solution twice into the patient's upper arm, upper thigh, abdomen, or buttocks (each injection in a different area).

 (b) Withdraw 1 mL of the supplied diluent (Sterile Water for Injection) and inject slowly onto the sides of the vial containing lyophilized powder of SOMAVERT.
Do not inject the diluent directly on the powder.
 (c) Do not invert the vial or shake the solution as this may cause denaturation  of the pegvisomant protein.
Slowly swirl the solution to ensure that all of the lyophilized powder has gone into solution.
If foaming of the reconstituted SOMAVERT solution is seen, the solution is likely damaged and therefore inappropriate to inject.
 (d) Visually inspect the reconstituted SOMAVERT solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
The reconstituted solution should be clear.
If the solution is cloudy, do not use it.
Once reconstituted, the solution will contain 20 mg of pegvisomant in 1 mL of solution.
 (e) Withdraw the 1 mL reconstituted SOMAVERT solution.
The solution must be
 administered within 6 hours of reconstitution.
  (f) Inject the first reconstituted SOMAVERT solution (20 mg/mL) subcutaneously into the patient's upper arm, upper thigh, abdomen, or buttocks using a 90-degree angle.
 (g) Repeat steps (a) to (e) to reconstitute the second Somavert dose of 20mg.
(h) Finally, inject the second reconstituted SOMAVERT solution (20 mg/mL)
 subcutaneously into the patient's upper arm, upper thigh, abdomen, or buttocks using a 90-degree angle (different area than the first injection).
 2.4 Maintenance Dose Injection Procedure For patient or caregiver instructions for reconstitution and administration of daily doses (10 to 30 mg), see the Patient's Instructions for Use.
 a)  Before administering the dose, remove one package (1 vial of lyophilized powder of SOMAVERT containing 10, 15 or 20 mg of pegvisomant and 1 vial containing the diluent) from the refrigerator about 10 minutes prior to the planned injection time.
 b)  Withdraw 1 mL of the supplied 10 ml diluent (Sterile Water for Injection) and inject slowly onto the sides of the vial containing lyophilized powder of SOMAVERT.
Do not inject the diluent directly on the powder.
 c)  Do not invert the vial or shake the solution as this may cause denaturation of the pegvisomant protein.
Slowly swirl the solution to ensure that all of the lyophilized powder has gone into solution.
If foaming of the reconstituted SOMAVERT solution is seen, the solution is likely is damaged and therefore inappropriate to inject.
 d)  Visually inspect the reconstituted SOMAVERT solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
The reconstituted solution should be clear.
If the solution is cloudy, do not use it.
Once reconstituted, the solution will contain 10, 15 or 20 mg of pegvisomant in 1 mL of solution.
 e)  Withdraw the 1 mL reconstituted SOMAVERT solution.
The solution must be administered within 6 hours of reconstitution.
 f)  Inject the reconstituted SOMAVERT solution subcutaneously into the upper arm, upper thigh, abdomen, or buttocks using a 90-degree angle.
 g)  If the total daily dosage is 25 or 30 mg then, repeat steps (a) to (e) to reconstitute the second Somavert dose to achieve a total dose of 25 or 30 mg.
 h)  If the total daily dosage is 25 or 30 mg, inject the second reconstituted SOMAVERT solution subcutaneously into the upper arm, upper thigh, abdomen, or buttocks using a 90-degree angle (different area than the first injection).

 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
 None.
 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 5.1 Hypoglycemia associated with GH lowering in patients with Diabetes Mellitus
 GH opposes the effects of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism by decreasing insulin sensitivity; thus, glucose tolerance may improve in some patients treated with SOMAVERT.
Patients should be carefully monitored and doses of anti-diabetic drugs reduced as necessary to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus.
 5.2 Liver Test Elevations
 Baseline serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels should be obtained prior to initiating therapy with SOMAVERT.
Table 1 lists recommendations regarding initiation of treatment with SOMAVERT, based on the results of these liver tests (LTs).
 Asymptomatic, transient elevations in transaminases up to 15 times ULN have been observed in &lt; 2% of subjects among two open-label trials (with a total of 147 patients).
These reports were not associated with an increase in bilirubin.
Transaminase elevations normalized with time, most often after suspending treatment (SOMAVERT should be used in accordance with the information presented in Table 2 with respect to liver test abnormalities while on Somavert treatment).

Recommendations of Initiating SOMAVERT Based on Baseline LTs and Periodic
 Monitoring of LTs During SOMAVERT Treatment
  Baseline LT Levels Recommendations
 Normal &#x2022; May treat with SOMAVERT.
&#x2022; Monitor LTs at monthly intervals during the first 6 months of
 treatment, quarterly for the next 6 months and then biannually for the next year.
 Elevated, but less than or equal to 3 times ULN
 May treat with SOMAVERT; however, monitor LTs monthly for at least one year after initiation of therapy and then bi-annually for the next year.
 Greater than 3 times ULN
 &#x2022; Do not treat with SOMAVERT until a comprehensive workup establishes the cause of the patient's liver dysfunction.
 &#x2022; Determine if cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis is present, particularly in patients with a history of prior therapy with somatostatin analogs.
 &#x2022; Based on the workup, consider initiation of therapy with SOMAVERT.
 &#x2022; If the decision is to treat, LTs and clinical symptoms should be monitored very closely.
 If a patient develops LT elevations, or any other signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction while receiving SOMAVERT, the following patient management is recommended (Table 2).
 Table 2.
Clinical Recommendations Based on Liver Test Results While on SOMAVERT LT Levels and Clinical
 Signs/Symptoms Recommendations
 Greater than or equal to 3 but less than 5 times ULN (without signs/symptoms of hepatitis or other liver injury, or increase in serum TBIL)
 &#x2022; May continue therapy with SOMAVERT.
However, monitor LTs weekly to determine if further increases occur (see below).
 &#x2022; Perform a comprehensive hepatic workup to discern if an alternative cause of liver dysfunction is present.
 At least 5 times ULN, or transaminase elevations at least 3 times ULN associated with any increase in serum TBIL (with or without signs/symptoms of hepatitis or other liver injury)
 &#x2022; Discontinue SOMAVERT immediately.
&#x2022; Perform a comprehensive hepatic workup, including serial LTs,
 to determine if and when serum levels return to normal.
&#x2022; If LTs normalize (regardless of whether an alternative cause of
 the liver dysfunction is discovered), consider cautious reinitiation of therapy with SOMAVERT, with frequent LT monitoring.
 Signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis or other liver injury (e.g., jaundice, bilirubinuria, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, ascites, unexplained edema, easy bruisability)
 &#x2022; Immediately perform a comprehensive hepatic workup.
&#x2022; If liver injury is confirmed, the drug should be discontinued.
 5.3 Cross-Reactivity with GH Assays
 SOMAVERT has significant structural similarity to growth hormone (GH) which causes it to cross-react in commercially available GH assays.
Since serum concentrations of therapeutically effective doses of SOMAVERT are generally 100 to 1000 times higher than the actual serum GH concentrations seen in patients with acromegaly, measurements of serum GH concentrations will appear falsely elevated.
 Reference ID: 3420012

                                                                                                                                                                    5.4 Lipohypertrophy
 There have been cases of lipohypertrophy in patients treated with SOMAVERT.
In a double-blind, 12-week, placebo-controlled study, there was one case (1.3%) of injection site lipohypertrophy reported in a subject receiving 10 mg/day.
The subject recovered while on treatment.
Among two open-label trials (with a total of 147 patients), there were two subjects, both receiving 10 mg/day, who developed lipohypertrophy.
One case recovered while on treatment, and one case resulted in a discontinuation of treatment.
Injection sites should be rotated daily to help prevent lipohypertrophy (different area than the last injection).
 5.5 Systemic Hypersensitivity
 In subjects with systemic hypersensitivity reactions, caution and close monitoring should be exercised when re-initiating Somavert therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)].
 6  ADVERSE REACTIONS
 Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other section of the labeling include:
 &#x2022;  Hypoglycemia associated with GH lowering in patients with Diabetes Mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 &#x2022;  Liver test elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] &#x2022;  Cross-reactivity with GH assay [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] &#x2022;  Lipohypertrophy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] &#x2022;  Systemic hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
 Elevations of serum concentrations of ALT and AST greater than ten times the ULN were reported in two patients (0.8%) exposed to SOMAVERT in pre-approval clinical studies.
One patient was rechallenged with SOMAVERT, and the recurrence of elevated transaminase levels suggested a probable causal relationship between administration of the drug and the elevation in liver enzymes.
A liver biopsy performed on the second patient was consistent with chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology.
In both patients, the transaminase elevations normalized after discontinuation of the drug.
 Elevations in ALT and AST levels were not associated with increased levels of TBIL and ALP, with the exception of two patients with minimal associated increases in ALP levels (i.e., less than 3 times ULN).
The transaminase elevations did not appear to be related to the dose of SOMAVERT administered, generally occurred within 4 to 12 weeks of initiation of therapy, and were not associated with any identifiable biochemical, phenotypic, or genetic predictors.
 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 In a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, fixed-dose study of SOMAVERT in subjects with acromegaly, 32 subjects received placebo and 80 subjects received SOMAVERT once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)].
A total of 108 subjects (30 placebo, 78 Somavert) completed 12 weeks of study treatment.

Most adverse events did not appear to be dose-dependent.
Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse events that were reported in at least two patients treated with SOMAVERT and at frequencies greater than placebo during the 12-week, placebo-controlled study.

 6.2 Immunogenicity
 In pre-marketing clinical studies, approximately 17% of the SOMAVERT-treated patients developed low titer, non-neutralizing anti-GH antibodies.
Although the presence of these antibodies did not appear to impact the efficacy of SOMAVERT, the long-term clinical significance of these antibodies is not known.
No assay for anti-pegvisomant antibodies is commercially available for patients receiving SOMAVERT.
 The data above reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to SOMAVERT.
 The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.
Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.
For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SOMAVERT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.

                                                                                                                 6.3 Postmarketing Experience
 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SOMAVERT.
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 Systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions, laryngospasm, angioedema, generalized skin reactions (rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria) have been reported in post-marketing use.
Some patients required hospitalization.
Symptoms did not re-occur in all patients after re-challenge [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
 Registry of Patients with Acromegaly Treated with SOMAVERT ACROSTUDY is an international observational registry that captures long term safety data in patients with acromegaly treated with SOMAVERT, as used in clinical practice.
Treatment dose and schedule were at the discretion of each treating physician.
Although safety monitoring as per the recommended schedule was mandatory, not all assessments were performed at all time points for every patient.
Because of this, comparison of rates of adverse events to those in the original clinical trial is not appropriate.
In an interim report, there were 1288 patients enrolled (mean duration of treatment 3.7 years).
 At the start of SOMAVERT treatment 648 patients were on SOMAVERT monotherapy for acromegaly.
Of the 454 patients who had a normal AST and ALT at baseline, 4 patients had elevated tests &gt;3 times ULN, two of whom had elevated tests &gt;5 times ULN.
 Lipohypertrophy was reported in 6 (0.5%) patients.
 MRIs were compared to any previous ones, and a change in tumor volume was reported as significant locally only if the diameter increased by more than 3 mm for microadenomas or volume increased by more than 20% for macroadenomas.
 All MRI changes considered significant at the local reading were reanalyzed centrally.
Of the 747 patients who had a MRI reported at baseline and at least once during follow up in the study, 51 (7%) were reported to have an increase by local MRI.
 Of these, 16 patients (2%) had confirmation of this increase, 6 patients had a decrease, 12 had "no change"; there was 1 with insufficient data and 16 patients did not have a central MRI reading.

 7.1 Insulin and/or Oral hypoglycemic Agents
 After initiation of SOMAVERT, patients with acromegaly and diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents may require dose reductions of insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
 7.2 Opioids
 In clinical studies, patients taking opioids often needed higher SOMAVERT doses to normalize IGF-I concentrations compared with patients not receiving opioids.
The mechanism of this interaction is not known.
 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 8.1 Pregnancy
 Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Early embryonic development and teratology studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits with pegvisomant at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day.
There was no evidence of teratogenic effects associated with pegvisomant treatment during organogenesis.
At the 10mg/kg/day dose (10 times the maximum human therapeutic dose based on body surface area), a reproducible, slight increase in post-implantation loss was observed in both studies.
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses, SOMAVERT should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
 8.3 Nursing Mothers
 It is not known whether pegvisomant is excreted in human milk.
Because many drugs are excreted in milk, caution should be exercised when SOMAVERT is administered to a nursing woman.
 8.4 Pediatric Use
 The safety and effectiveness of SOMAVERT in pediatric patients have not been established.
 8.5 Geriatric Use
 Clinical studies of SOMAVERT did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.
In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
 8.6 Renal Impairment
 SOMAVERT was not studied in patients with renal impairment and the safety and efficacy in these patients is not known.
 Reference ID: 3420012

                                                                                   9 OVERDOSAGE
 In one reported incident of acute overdose with SOMAVERT during pre-marketing clinical studies, a patient self-administered 80 mg/day (2.7 times the maximum recommended maintenance dosage) for seven days.
The patient experienced a slight increase in fatigue, had no other complaints, and demonstrated no significant clinical laboratory abnormalities.
 In cases of overdose, administration of SOMAVERT should be discontinued and not resumed until IGF-I levels return to within or above the normal range.
 10 DESCRIPTION
 SOMAVERT contains pegvisomant, an analog of human growth hormone (GH) that has been structurally altered to act as a GH receptor antagonist.
 Pegvisomant is a protein of recombinant DNA origin containing 191 amino acid residues to which several polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers are covalently bound (predominantly 4 to 6 PEG/protein molecule).
The molecular weight of the protein of pegvisomant is 21,998 Daltons.
The molecular weight of the PEG portion of pegvisomant is approximately 5000 Daltons.
The predominant molecular weights of pegvisomant are thus approximately 42,000, 47,000, and 52,000 Daltons.
The schematic shows the amino acid sequence of the pegvisomant protein (PEG polymers are shown attached to the 5 most probable attachment sites).
Pegvisomant is synthesized by a specific strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically modified by the addition of a plasmid that carries a gene for GH receptor antagonist.
Biological potency is determined using a cell proliferation bioassay.
Binding of Somavert to the GH receptor results in disruption of the proper binding of the second GH receptor with inhibition of functional receptor dimerization and subsequent intracellular signaling.
 Stippled residues indicate PEG attachment sites (Phe 1, Lys 38, Lys 41, Lys 70, Lys 115, Lys 120, Lys 140,
 Lys 145, Lys 158)
  Shown below are the amino acid substitutions in pegvisomant, relative to human GH.

 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 12.1 Mechanism of Action
 Pegvisomant selectively binds to growth hormone (GH) receptors on cell surfaces, where it blocks the binding of endogenous GH, and thus interferes with GH signal transduction.
 Inhibition of GH action results in decreased serum concentrations of IGF-I, as well as other GH-responsive serum proteins such as free IGF-I, the acid-labile subunit of IGF-I (ALS), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3).
 12.2 Pharmacodynamics
 Pegvisomant binds selectively to the GH receptor, and does not cross-react with 19 other cytokine receptors tested, including prolactin.
Pegvisomant leads to decreased serum concentrations of IGF-I, free IGF-I, ALS, and IGFBP-3 [see Clinical Studies (14, Figure 1)].

                                                                                                                       12.3 Pharmacokinetics
 Absorption: Following subcutaneous administration, peak serum pegvisomant concentrations are not generally attained until 33 to 77 hours after administration.
The mean extent of absorption of a 20-mg subcutaneous dose was 57%, relative to a 10-mg intravenous dose.
 Distribution: The mean apparent volume of distribution of pegvisomant is 7 L (12% coefficient of variation), suggesting that pegvisomant does not distribute extensively into tissues.
After a single subcutaneous administration, exposure (C max , AUC) to pegvisomant increases disproportionately with increasing dose.
Mean  SEM serum pegvisomant concentrations after 12 weeks of therapy with daily doses of 10, 15, and 20 mg were 6600  1330; 16,000  2200; and 27,000  3100 ng/mL, respectively.
 Metabolism and Elimination: The pegvisomant molecule contains covalently bound polyethylene glycol polymers in order to reduce the clearance rate.
Clearance of pegvisomant following multiple doses is lower than seen following a single dose.
The mean total body systemic clearance of pegvisomant following multiple doses is estimated to range between 36 to 28 mL/h for subcutaneous doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg/day, respectively.
Clearance of pegvisomant was found to increase with body weight.
Pegvisomant is eliminated from serum with a mean half-life of approximately 74 - 172 hours following either single or multiple doses.
Less than 1% of administered drug is recovered in the urine over 96 hours.
The elimination route of pegvisomant has not been studied in humans.
 Drug Interaction Studies In clinical studies, patients on opioids often needed higher serum pegvisomant concentrations to achieve appropriate IGF-I suppression compared with patients not receiving opioids.
The mechanism of this interaction is not known [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].
 Specific Populations No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment, patients with hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, or pediatric patients and the effects of race on the pharmacokinetics of pegvisomant has not been studied.
No gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of pegvisomant was found in a population pharmacokinetic analysis.
 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 Carcinogenesis Pegvisomant was administered subcutaneously to rats daily for 2 years at doses of 2, 8 and 20 mg/kg (about 2, 10 and 25-fold a single 20 mg dose in humans on an AUC basis).
Long term treatment with pegvisomant at 8 and 20 mg/kg caused an increase in malignant fibrous histiocytoma at injection sites in males.
Injection site tumors were not seen in female rats at the same doses.
The increased incidence of injection site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections.
 Mutagenesis Pegvisomant did not cause genetic damage in standard in vitro assays (bacterial mutation, human lymphocyte chromosome aberration).

 14 CLINICAL STUDIES
 A total of one hundred twelve patients (63 men and 49 women) with acromegaly participated in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study comparing placebo and SOMAVERT.
The mean SD age was 4814 years, and the mean duration of acromegaly was 88 years.
Ninety three had undergone previous pituitary surgery, of which 57 had also been treated with conventional radiation therapy.
Six patients had undergone irradiation without surgery, nine had received only drug therapy, and four had received no previous therapy.
At study start, the mean  SD time since the subjects' last surgery and/or irradiation therapy, respectively, was 6.8  0.93 years (n=63) and 5.6  0.57 years (n=93).
 Subjects were qualified for enrollment if their serum IGF-I, drawn after the required drug washout period, was &#x2265;1.3 times the upper limit of the age-adjusted normal range.
They were randomly assigned at the baseline visit to one of four treatment groups: placebo (n=32), 10 mg/day (n=26), 15 mg/day (n= 26), or 20 mg/day (n=28) of SOMAVERT subcutaneouslyIGF-I.
The primary efficacy endpoint was IGF-Ipercent change in IGF-I concentrations from baseline to week 12.
The three groups that received SOMAVERT showed statistically significant (p&lt;0.01) reductions in serum levels of IGF-I compared with the placebo group (Table 4).

Percent of Patients Whose IGF-I Levels
 Normalized at Week 12
  Table 5 shows the effect of treatment with SOMAVERT on ring size (standard jeweler's sizes converted to a numeric score ranging from 1 to 63), and on signs and symptoms of acromegaly.
Each individual score for a sign or symptom of acromegaly (for soft-tissue swelling, arthralgia, headache, perspiration and fatigue) was based on a nine-point ordinal rating scale (0 = absent and 8 = severe and incapacitating), and the total score for signs or symptoms of acromegaly was derived from the sum of the individual scores.
Mean baseline scores were as follows: ring size = 47.1; total signs and symptoms = 15.2; soft tissue swelling = 2.5; arthralgia = 3.2; headache = 2.4; perspiration = 3.3; and fatigue = 3.7.

 Serum growth hormone (GH) concentrations, as measured by research assays using antibodies that do not cross-react with pegvisomant, rose within two weeks of beginning treatment with SOMAVERT.
The largest increase in GH concentration was seen in patients treated with doses of SOMAVERT 20 mg/day.
This effect is presumably the result of diminished inhibition of GH secretion as IGF-I levels fall.
As shown in Figure 3, when patients with acromegaly were given a loading dose of SOMAVERT followed by a fixed daily dose, the rise in GH was inversely proportional to the fall in IGF-I and generally stabilized by week 2.

 In the open-label extension to the clinical study, 109 subjects (including 6 new patients) with mean treatment exposure of 42.6 weeks (range 1 day - 82 weeks), 93 (85.3%) subjects had an adverse event, 16 (14.7%) had an SAE, and 4 (3.7%) discontinued due to an AE (headaches, elevated liver function tests, pancreatic cancer, and weight gain).
A total of 100 (92.6%) of the 108 subjects with available IGF-I data had a normal IGF-I concentration at any visit during the study.

 Step 9.
Make sure that 1 mL of diluent remains in the diluent syringe.
Pull the needle out of the vial.
The vial should still have diluent in it.
Do not use the leftover diluent in the vial.

                                                 Step 10.
Push the needle of the diluent syringe straight through the stopper of the vial of powdered SOMAVERT.
 Tilt the diluent syringe to the side and gently push the plunger in to inject the diluent down the inner side of the SOMAVERT powder vial.
Be sure the diluent does not fall directly on the powder, but flows down the inside wall of the vial.
See Figure H.
 Figure H
 Step 11.
When the diluent syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the powder vial.
 Throw away the diluent vial with the leftover liquid in it.
Throw away the diluent syringe and needle in the sharps container as your healthcare provider told you.
See "Disposing of used needles and syringes" at the end of these instructions.
 Step 12.
Hold the medicine vial of SOMAVERT upright between your hands and gently roll it to dissolve the powder into a solution.

 &#x2022;  Do not shake the medicine vial.
Shaking may destroy the
 medicine.
  &#x2022;  The liquid medicine should be clear after the powder is dissolved.
Do not use the vial if:
 o  the liquid medicine looks cloudy, hazy, or slightly colored or o  you see solid particles in the liquid medicine or o you see foam in the vial
 Tell your pharmacist and ask for another vial.
Do not throw the vial away because the pharmacist may ask that you return it.
 &#x2022;  Inject SOMAVERT within 6 hours of mixing it.
If you wait more than 6 hours, you must throw away the medicine without injecting it.
 &#x2022;  Each mixed medicine vial contains 1 dose of SOMAVERT.
Do not split the liquid medicine into multiple doses.
 Preparing your SOMAVERT injection syringe:
 Step 13.
Clean the rubber stopper of the vial of SOMAVERT with an alcohol swab.
 &#x2022;  Carefully remove the cap from the insulin syringe and set the cap on the table.
 &#x2022;  Pull the insulin syringe plunger out to the 1 mL mark.
With 1 hand, firmly hold the vial.
With the other hand, push the needle straight through the center of the rubber stopper and deep into the vial.
Gently push the plunger in until the air is injected into the medicine vial.
See Figure J.

 Step 15.
Slide 1 hand carefully down the medicine solution vial so you can firmly hold the neck of the vial with your thumb and forefinger.
Hold the upper part of the syringe with your other fingers.
With the other hand, slowly pull the plunger out to slightly past the 1 mL mark on the insulin syringe.
See Figure L.

Check the insulin syringe for air bubbles.
If you see bubbles, tap the insulin syringe barrel until the bubbles rise to the top of the syringe.
Carefully push the plunger in to push only the air bubbles back into the vial.
See Figure M.
 Figure M
 Step 17.
Withdraw the entire 1 mL of medicine solution from the vial.
If your dose of SOMAVERT is less than 1 mL, your healthcare provider will tell you how much medicine solution to withdraw.
Slowly withdraw the needle to keep the tip in the liquid until you get all the medicine solution you need out of the vial.
See Figure N.
 Reference ID: 3420012

                                   Note: &#x2022;  If your dose of SOMAVERT is less than 1 mL, your healthcare provider
 will tell you how much medicine solution to withdraw.
&#x2022;  If your dose of SOMAVERT is more than 1 mL, your healthcare provider
 will tell you how much more medicine solution to withdraw from a second vial into another syringe, and where to give your second injection.
 Set the syringe and needle on the table without anything touching the needle.

 Selecting your SOMAVERT injection site:
 Step 18.
SOMAVERT is injected under the skin (subcutaneous).
Injection sites may include your upper arm, upper thigh, stomach area (abdomen) and buttocks.
See Figure O.

                                                     Figure O
 &#x2022;  Choose your injection site from 1 of the areas your healthcare provider told you to use.
 &#x2022;  Choose a different injection site each day so lumps do not develop in your skin.
Keep a record of each day's injection site as you inject your daily dose of SOMAVERT.
 &#x2022;  Do not use an area of your body that has: o a rash o broken skin o bruising o lumps in your skin
 &#x2022;  If you need to give 2 injections for your dose of SOMAVERT, choose a different site for your second injection.
 Giving your SOMAVERT injection:
 Step 19.
Clean your injection site with an alcohol swab.
See Figure P.
 Let your skin dry before you inject your medicine.
