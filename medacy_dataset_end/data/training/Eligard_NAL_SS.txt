 1.
 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ELIGARD is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
 2.
 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION As with other similar agents, the use of gloves is recommended during mixing and administration.1
 ELIGARD is administered subcutaneously and provides continuous release of leuprolide acetate over a one-, three-, four-, or six-month treatment period (Table 1).
 The injection delivers the dose of leuprolide acetate incorporated in a polymer formulation.
 Table 1.
ELIGARD Recommended Dosing Dosage 7.5 mg 22.5 mg 30 mg 45 mg Recommended Dose 1 injection
 every month 1 injection every 3 months
 1 injection every 4 months
 1 injection every 6 months
 Once mixed, ELIGARD should be discarded if not administered within 30 minutes.
 As with other drugs administered by subcutaneous injection, the injection site should vary periodically.
 The specific injection location chosen should be an area with sufficient soft or loose subcutaneous tissue.
 In clinical trials, the injection was administered in the upper- or mid-abdominal area.
 Avoid areas with brawny or fibrous subcutaneous tissue or locations that could be rubbed or compressed (i.e., with a belt or clothing waistband).
 2.1 Mixing Procedure IMPORTANT: Allow the product to reach room temperature before using.
Once mixed, the product must be administered within 30 minutes.
Follow the instructions as directed to ensure proper preparation of ELIGARD prior to administration:
 ELIGARD is packaged in either thermoformed trays or pouches.
Each carton contains:
 &#x2022;  One sterile Syringe A pre-filled with the ATRIGEL Delivery System
 &#x2022;  One Syringe B pre-filled with leuprolide acetate powder
 &#x2022;  One long white plunger rod for use with Syringe B
 &#x2022;  One sterile needle or One sterile safety needle

CONTRAINDICATIONS
 4.1 Hypersensitivity ELIGARD is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogs or any of the components of ELIGARD.
 Anaphylactic reactions to synthetic GnRH or GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the literature.
 4.2.
Pregnancy ELIGARD may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
Expected hormonal changes that occur with ELIGARD treatment increase the risk for pregnancy loss and fetal harm when administered to a pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
 ELIGARD is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.
If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
 5.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 5.1 Tumor Flare ELIGARD 7.5 mg 22.5 mg 30 mg, like other GnRH agonists, causes a transient increase in serum concentrations of testosterone during the first week of treatment.
ELIGARD 45 mg causes a transient increase in serum concentrations of testosterone during the first two weeks of treatment.
 Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment, including bone pain, neuropathy, hematuria, or bladder outlet obstruction.
  Reference ID: 3642365
                                                                                                          Cases of ureteral obstruction and/or spinal cord compression, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications, have been observed in the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer using GnRH agonists.
 Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy.
If spinal cord compression or ureteral obstruction develops, standard treatment of these complications should be instituted.
 5.2 Laboratory Tests Response to ELIGARD should be monitored by measuring serum concentrations of testosterone and prostate specific antigen periodically.
 In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above Baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to Baseline levels or below by the end of the second or third week.
 Castrate levels were generally reached within two to four weeks.
 Castrate testosterone levels were maintained for the duration of the treatment with ELIGARD 7.5 mg.
 No increases to above the castrate level occurred in any of the patients.
 Castrate levels were generally maintained for the duration of treatment with ELIGARD 22.5 mg.
 Once castrate levels were achieved with ELIGARD 30 mg, most (86/89) patients remained suppressed throughout the study.
 Once castrate levels were achieved with ELIGARD 45 mg, only one patient (&lt; 1%) experienced a breakthrough, with testosterone levels &gt; 50 ng/dL.
 Results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology.
It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions.
 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Therapy with leuprolide acetate results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system.
 Results of diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during and after leuprolide therapy may be affected.
 5.3 Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists.
Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes.
Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes.
 5.4 Cardiovascular Diseases Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men.
The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice.
 Reference ID: 3642365
                                                               5.5 Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval.
Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval.
Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected.
Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes.
 6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
 6.1 Clinical trial experience The safety of all ELIGARD formulations was evaluated in clinical trials involving patients with advanced prostate cancer.
 In addition, the safety of ELIGARD 7.5 mg was evaluated in 8 surgically castrated males (Table 4).
 ELIGARD, like other GnRH analogs, caused a transient increase in serum testosterone concentrations during the first one to two weeks of treatment.
 Therefore, potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms of the disease during the first weeks of treatment are of concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction or hematuria.
If these conditions are aggravated, it may lead to neurological problems such as weakness and/or paresthesia of the lower limbs or worsening of urinary symptoms [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].
During the clinical trials, injection sites were closely monitored.
 Refer to Table 3 for a summary of reported injection site events.

 Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with a GnRH agonist analog.
 It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density.
 6.2 Postmarketing experience
 During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.
In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour.
In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse.
Immediate medical attention has been required.
 Convulsions have also been reported in the postmarketing setting.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 8.1 Pregnancy
 Pregnancy category X. [See &#x2018;Contraindications&#x2019; section]
  ELIGARD is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant while receiving the drug.
Expected hormonal changes that occur with ELIGARD treatment increase the risk for pregnancy loss.
If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the potential risk for pregnancy loss.
 In non-clinical studies in rats, major fetal abnormalities were observed after administration of leuprolide acetate throughout gestation.
 There were increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights in rats and rabbits.
 The effects of fetal mortality are expected consequences of the alterations in hormonal levels brought about by this drug.
The possibility exists that spontaneous abortion may occur.
 8.3 Nursing Mothers: ELIGARD is not indicated for use in women [see Indications and Usage (1)].
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Eligard, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ELIGARD in pediatric patients have not been established.
 8.5 Geriatric Use The majority of the patients (approximately 70%) studied in the clinical trials were age 70 and older.
 10.
OVERDOSAGE In clinical trials using daily subcutaneous injections of leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer, doses as high as 20 mg/day for up to two years caused no adverse effects differing from those observed with the 1 mg/day dose.

DESCRIPTION ELIGARD is a sterile polymeric matrix formulation of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, for subcutaneous injection.
 It is designed to deliver leuprolide acetate at a controlled rate over a one-, three-, four- or six-month therapeutic period.
 Reference ID: 3642365
                                                    Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) that, when given continuously, inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion and suppresses testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis.
 The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone.
 The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-Ltryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt)
 with the following structural formula:
 ELIGARD is prefilled and supplied in two separate, sterile syringes whose contents are mixed immediately prior to administration.
 The two syringes are joined and the single dose product is mixed until it is homogenous.
 ELIGARD is administered subcutaneously, where it forms a solid drug delivery depot.
  One syringe contains the ATRIGEL Delivery System and the other contains leuprolide acetate.
 ATRIGEL is a polymeric (non-gelatin containing) delivery system consisting of a biodegradable poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGH or PLG) polymer formulation dissolved in a biocompatible solvent, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP).
 Refer to Table 5 for the delivery system composition and constituted product formulation for each ELIGARD product.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 12.1 Mechanism of Action Leuprolide acetate, a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion when given continuously in therapeutic doses.
 Animal and human studies indicate that after an initial stimulation, chronic administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis.
 This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy.
 In humans, administration of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males, and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females).
 However, continuous administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH.
In males, testosterone is reduced to below castrate threshold (&lt; 50 ng/dL).
 These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment.
Long-term studies have shown that continuation of therapy with leuprolide acetate maintains testosterone below the castrate level for up to seven years.
 Reference ID: 3642365
                                                                              12.2 Pharmacodynamics Following the first dose of ELIGARD, mean serum testosterone concentrations transiently increased, then fell to below castrate threshold (&lt; 50 ng/dL) within three weeks for all ELIGARD concentrations.
 Continued monthly treatment with ELIGARD 7.5 mg maintained castrate testosterone suppression throughout the study.
 No breakthrough of testosterone concentrations above castrate threshold (&gt; 50 ng/dL) occurred at any time during the study once castrate suppression was achieved (Figure 17).
 One patient received less than a full dose of ELIGARD 22.5 mg at baseline, never suppressed and withdrew from the study at Day 73.
 Of the 116 patients remaining in the study, 115 (99%) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold by Month 1 (Day 28).
 By Day 35, 116 (100%) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold.
 Once testosterone suppression was achieved, one patient (&lt; 1%) demonstrated breakthrough (concentrations &gt; 50 ng/dL after achieving castrate levels) following the initial injection; that patient remained below the castrate threshold following the second injection (Figure 18).
 One patient withdrew from the ELIGARD 30 mg study at Day 14.
 Of the 89 patients remaining in the study, 85 (96%) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold by Month 1 (Day 28).
 By Day 42, 89 (100%) of patients attained castrate testosterone suppression.
 Once castrate testosterone suppression was achieved, three patients (3%) demonstrated breakthrough (concentrations &gt; 50 ng/dL after achieving castrate levels) (Figure 19).
 One patient at Day 1 and another patient at Day 29 were withdrawn from the ELIGARD 45 mg study.
 Of the 109 patients remaining in the study, 108 (99.1%) had serum testosterone levels below the castrate threshold by Month 1 (Day 28).
 One patient did not achieve castrate suppression and was withdrawn from the study at Day 85.
 Once castrate testosterone suppression was achieved, one patient (&lt; 1%) demonstrated breakthrough (concentrations &gt; 50 ng/dL after achieving castrate levels) (Figure 20).
 Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally.
 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption ELIGARD 7.5 mg The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics observed during three once-monthly injections in 20 patients with advanced prostate cancer is shown in Figure 17.
 Mean serum leuprolide concentrations following the initial injection rose to 25.3 ng/mL (Cmax) at approximately 5 hours after injection.
 After the initial increase following each injection, serum concentrations remained relatively constant (0.28 &#x2013; 2.00 ng/mL).

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice.
In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses (0.6 to 4 mg/kg).
 There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males (highest incidence in the low dose group).
 In mice, no leuprolide acetate-induced tumors or pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years.
Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities.
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with ELIGARD.
 Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems and with ELIGARD 7.5 mg in bacterial systems.
 These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential.
 14.
CLINICAL STUDIES One open-label, multicenter study was conducted with each ELIGARD formulation (7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg) in patients with Jewett stage A though D prostate cancer who were treated with at least a single injection of study drug (Table 7).
 These studies evaluated the achievement and maintenance of castrate serum testosterone suppression over the duration of therapy (Figures 21-24).
 During the AGL9904 study using ELIGARD 7.5 mg, once testosterone suppression  was achieved, no patients (0%) demonstrated breakthrough (concentration &gt;50 ng/dL) at any time in the study.
 During the AGL9909 study using ELIGARD 22.5 mg, once testosterone suppression was achieved, only one patient (&lt; 1%) demonstrated breakthrough following the initial injection; that patient remained below the castrate threshold following the second injection.
 Reference ID: 3642365
                                         During the AGL0001 study using ELIGARD 30 mg, once testosterone suppression was achieved, three patients (3%) demonstrated breakthrough.
 In the first of these patients, a single serum testosterone concentration of 53 ng/dL was reported on the day after the second injection.
 In this patient, castrate suppression was reported for all other timepoints.
 In the second patient, a serum testosterone concentration of 66 ng/dL was reported immediately prior to the second injection.
 This rose to a maximum concentration of 147 ng/dL on the second day after the second injection.
 In this patient, castrate suppression was again reached on the seventh day after the second injection and was maintained thereafter.
 In the final patient, serum testosterone concentrations &gt; 50 ng/dL were reported at 2 and at 8 hours after the second injection.
 Serum testosterone concentration rose to a maximum of 110 ng/dL on the third day after the second injection.
In this patient, castrate suppression was again reached eighteen days after the second injection and was maintained until the final day of the study, when a single serum testosterone concentration of 55 ng/dL was reported.
 During the AGL0205 study using ELIGARD 45 mg, once testosterone suppression was achieved, one patient (&lt;1%) demonstrated breakthrough.
 This patient reached castrate suppression at Day 21 and remained suppressed until Day 308 when his testosterone level rose to 112 ng/dL.
 At Month 12 (Day 336), his testosterone was 210 ng/dL.
