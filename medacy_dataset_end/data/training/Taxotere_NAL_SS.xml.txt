 [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.8 Administration Precautions
 HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised when handling and preparing TAXOTERE solutions.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe use of gloves is recommended.
Please refer to [see How Supplied/ Storage and Handling (16.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIf TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion should come into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion should come into contact with mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash with water.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSContact of the TAXOTERE concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, the final TAXOTERE dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSOne-vial TAXOTERE (Injection Concentrate)TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution.
HIGHLIGHTS Please follow the preparation instructions provided below.
HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.9 Preparation and Administration
 HIGHLIGHTSDO NOT use the two-vial formulation (Injection Concentrate and diluent) with the one-vial formulation.
 HIGHLIGHTSOne-vial TAXOTERE (Injection Concentrate)TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate (20 mg/mL) requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution.
 HIGHLIGHTSUse only a 21 gauge needle to withdraw TAXOTERE from the vial because larger bore needles (e.g., 18 and 19 gauge) may result in stopper coring and rubber particulates.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS1.
TAXOTERE vials should be stored between 2 and 25C (36 and 77F).
 HIGHLIGHTSIf the vials are stored under refrigeration, allow the appropriate number of vials of TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate vials to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes before use.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.
Using only a 21 gauge needle, aseptically withdraw the required amount of TAXOTERE injection concentrate (20 mg docetaxel/mL) with a calibrated syringe and inject via a single injection (one shot) into a 250 mL infusion bag or bottle of either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL to 0.74 mg/mL.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf a dose greater than 200 mg of TAXOTERE is required, use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of 0.74 mg/mL TAXOTERE is not exceeded.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS3.
Thoroughly mix the infusion by gentle manual rotation.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS4.As with all parenteral products, TAXOTERE should be inspected visually for particulate
 HIGHLIGHTSmatter or discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf the TAXOTERE dilution for intravenous infusion is not clear or appears to have precipitation, it should be discarded.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.
TAXOTERE infusion solution is supersaturated, therefore may crystallize over time.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf crystals appear, the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe TAXOTERE dilution for infusion should be administered intravenously as a 1-hour infusion under ambient room temperature (below 25C) and lighting conditions.
HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.10 Stability
 HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE final dilution for infusion, if stored between 2C and 25C (36F and 77F) is stable for 6 hours.
 HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE final dilution for infusion (in either 0.9% Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution) should be used within 6 hours (including the 1 hour intravenous administration).
 HIGHLIGHTSIn addition, physical and chemical in-use stability of the infusion solution prepared as recommended has been demonstrated in non-PVC bags up to 48 hours when stored between 2C and 8C (36 and 46F).

 HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or to other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.
  HIGHLIGHTSSevere reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
 HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE should not be used in patients with neutrophil counts of &lt;1500 cells/mm3.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.1 Toxic Deaths
 HIGHLIGHTSBreast Cancer TAXOTERE administered at 100 mg/m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 times ULN together with AP &gt;2.5 times ULN).
Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m2 , mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function.
 HIGHLIGHTSApproximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle.
Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer TAXOTERE administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies).
 HIGHLIGHTSThere were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m2 dose in the randomized trials.
 HIGHLIGHTSAmong patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.2 Hepatic Impairment
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with combined abnormalities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with TAXOTERE [see Boxed Warning, Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical studies (14)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.3 Hematologic Effects
 HIGHLIGHTSPerform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving TAXOTERE.
  HIGHLIGHTSPatients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of TAXOTERE until neutrophils recover to a level &gt;1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 .
 HIGHLIGHTSA 25% reduction in the dose of TAXOTERE is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm3) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a TAXOTERE cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSNeutropenia (&lt;2000 neutrophils/mm3) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2 of TAXOTERE and grade 4 neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm3) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m2.
Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted.
HIGHLIGHTS TAXOTERE should not be administered to patients with neutrophils &lt;1500 cells/mm3 .
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSFebrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m2.
 HIGHLIGHTSHematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThree breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin &gt;1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
  HIGHLIGHTSIn gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not.
HIGHLIGHTS Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Adverse Reactions (6)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions.
HIGHLIGHTS Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or very rarely fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids.
HIGHLIGHTS Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the TAXOTERE infusion and aggressive therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSHypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a TAXOTERE infusion.
HIGHLIGHTS If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required.
 HIGHLIGHTSAll patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of TAXOTERE [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.5 Fluid Retention
 HIGHLIGHTSSevere fluid retention has been reported following TAXOTERE therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each TAXOTERE administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSWhen fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg.
 HIGHLIGHTSAmong 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%.
The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m2.
HIGHLIGHTS Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m2.
Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of TAXOTERE to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks).
HIGHLIGHTS Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.6 Acute Myeloid Leukemia
 HIGHLIGHTSTreatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.
HIGHLIGHTS In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received TAXOTERE, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].
In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.7 Cutaneous Reactions
 HIGHLIGHTSLocalized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed.
HIGHLIGHTSIn case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
 HIGHLIGHTSThe discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients.
 HIGHLIGHTSAmong 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued TAXOTERE due to skin toxicity.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.8 Neurologic Reactions
 HIGHLIGHTSSevere neurosensory symptoms (e.g. paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%.
When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks).
 HIGHLIGHTSSevere peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.9 Eye Disorders
 HIGHLIGHTSCystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf CME is diagnosed, TAXOTERE treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated.
 HIGHLIGHTSAlternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.10 Asthenia
 HIGHLIGHTSSevere asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%.
 HIGHLIGHTSSymptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.11 Alcohol Content
 HIGHLIGHTSCases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe alcohol content in a dose of TAXOTERE Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized.
HIGHLIGHTS Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in TAXOTERE Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion.
HIGHLIGHTSEach administration of TAXOTERE Injection at 100 mg/m2 delivers 2.0 g/m2 of ethanol.
For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m2, this would deliver 4.0 grams of ethanol [see Description (11)].
 HIGHLIGHTSOther docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.12 Use in Pregnancy
 HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel caused embryofetal toxicities including intrauterine mortality when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis.
 HIGHLIGHTSEmbryofetal effects in animals occurred at doses as low as 1/50 and 1/300 the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf TAXOTERE is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
 HIGHLIGHTSWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with TAXOTERE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTSThe most serious adverse reactions from TAXOTERE are:
 HIGHLIGHTSToxic Deaths [see Boxed Warning, Warning and Precautions (5.1)]
 HIGHLIGHTSHepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
 HIGHLIGHTSNeutropenia [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
 HIGHLIGHTS Hypersensitivity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
 HIGHLIGHTSFluid Retention [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe most common adverse reactions across all TAXOTERE indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia.
  HIGHLIGHTSIncidence varies depending on the indication.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSAdverse reactions are described according to indication.
 HIGHLIGHTSBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 HIGHLIGHTSResponding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6.1 Clinical Trial Experience
 HIGHLIGHTSBreast Cancer Monotherapy with TAXOTERE for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2:
 HIGHLIGHTSAdverse drug reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients are compared for three populations who received TAXOTERE administered at 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion every 3 weeks:
 HIGHLIGHTS2045 patients with various tumor types and normal baseline liver function tests; the subset of 965 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, both previously treated and untreated with chemotherapy, who had normal baseline liver function tests; and an additional 61 patients with various tumor types who had abnormal liver function tests at baseline.
 HIGHLIGHTSThese reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTSAt least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving TAXOTERE for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (See Table 3).

 HIGHLIGHTSFever and Infection Fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients.
 HIGHLIGHTSGrade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients respectively.
 HIGHLIGHTSInfection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients.
HIGHLIGHTS Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients respectively.
 HIGHLIGHTSThere were no septic deaths in either treatment arm.
 HIGHLIGHTSGastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation vs. one patient in the FAC arm.
Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSCardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm vs. the FAC arm; dysrhythmias, all grades (7.9% vs. 6.0%), hypotension, all grades (2.6% vs. 1.1%) and CHF (2.3% vs. 0.9%, at 70 months median follow-up).
 HIGHLIGHTSOne patient in each arm died due to heart failure.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia is known to occur in patients treated with anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.
  HIGHLIGHTSAML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSAML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316).
The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at 5 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis risk of AML is comparable to the risk observed for other anthracyclines/cyclophosphamide containing adjuvant breast chemotherapy regimens.

 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7.
DRUG INTERACTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4.
 Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel.
 HIGHLIGHTSConcomitant use of TAXOTERE and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn patients receiving treatment with TAXOTERE, close monitoring for toxicity and a TAXOTERE dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.1 Pregnancy
 HIGHLIGHTSPregnancy Category D [see "Warnings and Precautions" section ] Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, TAXOTERE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf TAXOTERE is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
 HIGHLIGHTSWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
HIGHLIGHTSStudies in both rats and rabbits at doses  &#x2030; 0.3 and 0.03 mg/kg/day, respectively (about 1/50 and 1/300 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis), administered during the period of organogenesis, have shown that TAXOTERE is embryotoxic and fetotoxic (characterized by intrauterine mortality, increased resorption, reduced fetal weight, and fetal ossification delay).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe doses indicated above also caused maternal toxicity.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.3 Nursing Mothers
 HIGHLIGHTSIt is not known whether docetaxel is excreted in human milk.
 HIGHLIGHTSBecause many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from TAXOTERE, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.4 Pediatric Use
 HIGHLIGHTSThe alcohol content in TAXOTERE Injection should be taken into account when given to pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].
 HIGHLIGHTSThe efficacy of TAXOTERE in pediatric patients as monotherapy or in combination has not been established.
HIGHLIGHTS The overall safety profile of TAXOTERE in pediatric patients receiving monotherapy or TCF was consistent with the known safety profile in adults.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE has been studied in a total of 289 pediatric patients: 239 in 2 trials with monotherapy and 50 in combination treatment with cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil (TCF).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE Monotherapy TAXOTERE monotherapy was evaluated in a dose-finding phase 1 trial in 61 pediatric patients (median age 12.5 years, range 1-22 years) with a variety of refractory solid tumors.
HIGHLIGHTSThe recommended dose was 125 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 21 days.
HIGHLIGHTSThe primary dose limiting toxicity was neutropenia.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe recommended dose for TAXOTERE monotherapy was evaluated in a phase 2 single-arm trial in 178 pediatric patients (median age 12 years, range 1-26 years) with a variety of recurrent/refractory solid tumors.
HIGHLIGHTS Efficacy was not established with tumor response rates ranging from one complete response (CR) (0.6%) in a patient with undifferentiated sarcoma to four partial responses (2.2%) seen in one patient each with Ewing Sarcoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE in Combination TAXOTERE was studied in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF) versus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) for the induction treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in pediatric patients prior to chemoradiation consolidation.
HIGHLIGHTS Seventy-five patients (median age 16 years, range 9 to 21 years) were randomized (2:1) to TAXOTERE (75 mg/m) in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/m) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m) (TCF) or to cisplatin (80 mg/m) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m/day) (CF).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe primary endpoint was the CR rate following induction treatment of NPC.
One patient out of 50 in the TCF group (2%) had a complete response while none of the 25 patients in the CF group had a complete response.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSPharmacokinetics:
HIGHLIGHTS Pharmacokinetic parameters for docetaxel were determined in 2 pediatric solid tumor trials.
HIGHLIGHTS Following docetaxel administration at 55 mg/m2 to 235 mg/m2 in a 1-hour intravenous infusion
HIGHLIGHTS every 3 weeks in 25 patients aged 1 to 20 years (median 11 years), docetaxel clearance was
HIGHLIGHTS 17.3 10.9 L/h/m2 .
HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel was administered in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TCF), at dose levels of 75 mg/m2 in a 1-hour intravenous infusion day 1 in 28 patients aged 10 to 21 years (median 16 years, 17 patients were older than 16).
HIGHLIGHTS  Docetaxel clearance was 17.9 8.75 L/h/m2 , corresponding to an AUC of 4.20 2.57  g.h/mL.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn summary, the body surface area adjusted clearance of docetaxel monotherapy and TCF combination in children were comparable to those in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.5 Geriatric Use
 HIGHLIGHTSIn general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer In a study conducted in chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC (TAX326), 148 patients (36%) in the TAXOTERE+cisplatin group were 65 years of age or greater.
 HIGHLIGHTSThere were 128 patients (32%) in the vinorelbine+cisplatin group 65 years of age or greater.
In the TAXOTERE+cisplatin group, patients less than 65 years of age had a median survival of 10.3 months (95% CI: 9.1 months, 11.8 months) and patients 65 years or older had a median survival of 12.1 months (95% CI: 9.3 months, 14 months).
 HIGHLIGHTSIn patients 65 years of age or greater treated with TAXOTERE+cisplatin, diarrhea (55%), peripheral edema (39%) and stomatitis (28%) were observed more frequently than in the vinorelbine+cisplatin group (diarrhea 24%, peripheral edema 20%, stomatitis 20%).
HIGHLIGHTS Patients treated with TAXOTERE+cisplatin who were 65 years of age or greater were more likely to experience diarrhea (55%), infections (42%), peripheral edema (39%) and stomatitis (28%) compared to patients less than the age of 65 administered the same treatment (43%, 31%, 31% and 21%, respectively).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSWhen TAXOTERE was combined with carboplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy-naive, advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, patients 65 years of age or greater (28%) experienced higher frequency of infection compared to similar patients treated with TAXOTERE+cisplatin, and a higher frequency of diarrhea, infection and peripheral edema than elderly patients treated with vinorelbine+cisplatin.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSProstate Cancer Of the 333 patients treated with TAXOTERE every three weeks plus prednisone in the prostate cancer study (TAX327), 209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn patients treated with TAXOTERE every three weeks, the following treatment emergent adverse reactions occurred at rates  &#x2030; 10% higher in patients 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients: anemia (71% vs. 59%), infection (37% vs. 24%), nail changes (34% vs. 23%), anorexia (21% vs. 10%), weight loss (15% vs. 5%) respectively.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSBreast Cancer In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316), TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide was administered to 744 patients of whom 48 (6%) were 65 years of age or greater.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe number of elderly patients who received this regimen was not sufficient to determine whether there were differences in safety and efficacy between elderly and younger patients.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSGastric Cancer Among the 221 patients treated with TAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study, 54 were 65 years of age or older and 2 patients were older than 75 years.
HIGHLIGHTSIn this study, the number of patients who were 65 years of age or older was insufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.
 However, the incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in the elderly patients compared to younger patients.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe incidence of the following adverse reactions (all grades, regardless of relationship): lethargy, stomatitis, diarrhea, dizziness, edema, febrile neutropenia/neutropenic infection occurred at rates  &#x2030; 10% higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients.
 Elderly patients treated with TCF should be closely monitored.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSHead and Neck Cancer Among the 174 and 251 patients who received the induction treatment with TAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) for SCCHN in the TAX323 and TAX324 studies, 18 (10%) and 32 (13%) of the patients were 65 years of age or older, respectively.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThese clinical studies of TAXOTERE in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with SCCHN did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.
HIGHLIGHTS Other reported clinical experience with this treatment regimen has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.6 Hepatic Impairment
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with bilirubin &gt;ULN should not receive TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTSAlso, patients with AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 x ULN should not receive TAXOTERE [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe alcohol content in TAXOTERE Injection should be taken into account when given to patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS10.OVERDOSAGE
 HIGHLIGHTSThere is no known antidote for TAXOTERE overdosage.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn case of overdosage, the patient should be kept in a specialized unit where vital functions can be closely monitored.
 HIGHLIGHTSAnticipated complications of overdosage include: bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity, and mucositis.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose.
 HIGHLIGHTSOther appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken, as needed.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn two reports of overdose, one patient received 150 mg/m2 and the other received 200 mg/m2 as 1-hour infusions.
 HIGHLIGHTSBoth patients experienced severe neutropenia, mild asthenia, cutaneous reactions, and mild paresthesia, and recovered without incident.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn mice, lethality was observed following single intravenous doses that were  &#x2030; 154 mg/kg (about 4.5 times the human dose of 100 mg/m2 on a mg/m2 basis); neurotoxicity associated with paralysis, non-extension of hind limbs, and myelin degeneration was observed in mice at 48 mg/kg (about 1.5 times the human dose of 100 mg/m2 basis).
 HIGHLIGHTSIn male and female rats, lethality was observed at a dose of 20 mg/kg (comparable to the human dose of 100 mg/m2 on a mg/m2 basis) and was associated with abnormal mitosis and necrosis of multiple organs.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS11.DESCRIPTION
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family.
 HIGHLIGHTSIt is prepared by semisynthesis beginning with a precursor extracted from the renewable needle biomass of yew plants.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe chemical name for docetaxel is (2R,3S)-N-carboxy-3-phenylisoserine,N-tert-butyl ester, 13-ester with 5-20epoxy-1,2,4,7,10,13-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4-acetate 2-benzoate, trihydrate.
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel has the following structural formula:
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel is a white to almost-white powder with an empirical formula of C43H53NO14
HIGHLIGHTS 3H2O, and a molecular weight of 861.9.
 HIGHLIGHTSIt is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSOne-vial TAXOTERE (Injection Concentrate)TAXOTERE (docetaxel) Injection Concentrate is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, pale yellow to brownish-yellow solution at 20 mg/mL concentration.
HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS Each mL contains 20 mg docetaxel (anhydrous) in 0.54 grams polysorbate 80 and 0.395 grams
HIGHLIGHTS dehydrated alcohol solution.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE is available in single use vials containing 20 mg (1 mL) or 80 mg (4 mL) docetaxel
HIGHLIGHTS (anhydrous).
HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS TAXOTERE Injection Concentrate requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the
HIGHLIGHTS infusion solution.
HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS12.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.1 Mechanism of Action
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions.
HIGHLIGHTS Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.
HIGHLIGHTS Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.3 Human Pharmacokinetics
 HIGHLIGHTSAbsorption: The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel have been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg/m2 to 115 mg/m2 in phase 1 studies.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe area under the curve (AUC) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg/m2 to 115 mg/m2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours.
Docetaxel's pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, with half-lives for the , , and  phases of 4 min, 36 min, and 11.1 hr, respectively.
Mean total body clearance was 21 L/h/m2 .
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSDistribution:  The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartments and the late (terminal) phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment.
HIGHLIGHTS Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn vitro studies showed that docetaxel is about 94% protein bound, mainly to 1-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins.
HIGHLIGHTS In three cancer patients, the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was found to be approximately 97%.
HIGHLIGHTS Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSMetabolism:  In vitro drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, and its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSElimination:  A study of 14C-docetaxel was conducted in three cancer patients.
Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and feces following oxidative metabolism of the tert-butyl ester group, but fecal excretion was the main elimination route.
 HIGHLIGHTSWithin 7 days, urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6% and 75% of the administered radioactivity, respectively.
 HIGHLIGHTSAbout 80% of the radioactivity recovered in feces is excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with very small amounts (less than 8%) of unchanged drug.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSEffect of Age:  A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after TAXOTERE treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg/m2.
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe pharmacokinetics of docetaxel were not influenced by age.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSEffect of Gender: The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.
 HIGHLIGHTSHepatic Impairment: The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment (AST and/or ALT &gt;1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 times ULN), total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27%, resulting in a 38% increase in systemic exposure (AUC).
 HIGHLIGHTSThis average, however, includes a substantial range and there is, at present, no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with TAXOTERE.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied.
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSEffect of Race:  Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg/m2 to 90 mg/m2 was similar to that of European/American populations dosed at 100 mg/m2, suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSEffect of Ketoconazole:  The effect of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients.
HIGHLIGHTS Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel (100 mg/m intravenous) alone or docetaxel (10 mg/m intravenous) in combination with ketoconazole (200 mg orally once daily for 3 days) in a crossover design with a 3week washout period.
HIGHLIGHTS The results of this study indicated that the mean dose-normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2.2-fold and its clearance was reduced by 49% when docetaxel was coadministration with ketoconazole [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug-Drug Interactions (7)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSEffect of Combination Therapies:  &#x20ac;&#x161; Dexamethasone:  Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone.
HIGHLIGHTS &#x20ac;&#x161; Cisplatin: Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone.
 HIGHLIGHTS &#x20ac;&#x161; Cisplatin and Fluorouracil: The combined administration of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug.
 HIGHLIGHTS &#x20ac;&#x161; Prednisone: A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone.
 HIGHLIGHTS &#x20ac;&#x161; Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin:  A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug-drug-interactions between docetaxel (75 mg/m), doxorubicin (50 mg/m), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m) when administered in combination.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn addition, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS13.NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTS13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of FertilityCarcinogenicity studies with docetaxel have not been performed.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosome aberration test in CHO-K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice administered doses of 0.39 to 1.56 mg/kg (about 1/60th to 1/15th the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis).
HIGHLIGHTS Docetaxel was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assays.
 HIGHLIGHTSDocetaxel did not reduce fertility in rats when administered in multiple intravenous doses of up to 0.3 mg/kg (about 1/50th the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis), but decreased testicular weights were reported.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis correlates with findings of a 10-cycle toxicity study (dosing once every 21 days for 6 months) in rats and dogs in which testicular atrophy or degeneration was observed at intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg in rats and 0.375 mg/kg in dogs (about 1/3rd and 1/15th the recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis, respectively).
 HIGHLIGHTSAn increased frequency of dosing in rats produced similar effects at lower dose levels.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.CLINICAL STUDIES
 HIGHLIGHTS14.1 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
 HIGHLIGHTSThe efficacy and safety of TAXOTERE have been evaluated in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy (alkylating agent-containing regimens or anthracycline containing regimens).
 HIGHLIGHTSRandomized Trials In one randomized trial, patients with a history of prior treatment with an anthracycline-containing regimen were assigned to treatment with TAXOTERE (100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) or the combination of mitomycin (12 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) and vinblastine (6 mg/m2 every 3 weeks).
 HIGHLIGHTSTwo hundred three patients were randomized to TAXOTERE and 189 to the comparator arm.
 HIGHLIGHTSMost patients had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease; only 27 patients on the TAXOTERE arm and 33 patients on the comparator arm entered the study following relapse after adjuvant therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSThree-quarters of patients had measurable, visceral metastases.
The primary endpoint was time to progression.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe following table summarizes the study results (See Table 12).

 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn another multicenter open-label, randomized trial (TAX313), in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer who progressed or relapsed after one prior chemotherapy regimen, 527 patients were randomized to receive TAXOTERE monotherapy 60 mg/m2 (n=151), 75 mg/m2 (n=188) or 100 mg/m2 (n=188).
 HIGHLIGHTSIn this trial, 94% of patients had metastatic disease and 79% had received prior anthracycline therapy.
  HIGHLIGHTSResponse rate was the primary endpoint.
Response rates increased with TAXOTERE dose: 19.9% for the 60 mg/m2 group compared to 22.3% for the 75 mg/m2 and 29.8% for the 100 mg/m2 group; pair-wise comparison between the 60 mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 groups was statistically significant (p=0.037).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSSingle Arm Studies TAXOTERE at a dose of 100 mg/m2 was studied in six single arm studies involving a total of 309 patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom previous chemotherapy had failed.
 HIGHLIGHTSAmong these, 190 patients had anthracycline-resistant breast cancer, defined as progression during an anthracycline containing chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, or relapse during an anthracycline-containing adjuvant regimen.
In anthracycline-resistant patients, the overall response rate was 37.9% (72/190; 95% C.I.: 31.0-44.8) and the complete response rate was 2.1%.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTAXOTERE was also studied in three single arm Japanese studies at a dose of 60 mg/m2 , in 174 patients who had received prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
HIGHLIGHTS Among 26 patients whose best response to an anthracycline had been progression, the response rate was 34.6% (95% C.I.: 17.2-55.7), similar to the response rate in single arm studies of 100 mg/m2 .
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.2 Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer
 HIGHLIGHTSA multicenter, open-label, randomized trial (TAX316) evaluated the efficacy and safety of TAXOTERE for the adjuvant treatment of patients with axillary-node-positive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastatic disease.
 HIGHLIGHTSAfter stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes (1-3, 4+), 1491 patients were randomized to receive either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (TAC arm), or doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg/m2 (FAC arm).
Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.
 TAXOTERE was administered as a 1-hour infusion; all other drugs were given as intravenous bolus on day 1.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn both arms, after the last cycle of chemotherapy, patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years.
  HIGHLIGHTSAdjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69% of patients who received TAC and 72% of patients who received FAC.
 HIGHLIGHTSResults from a second interim analysis (median follow-up 55 months) are as follows: In study TAX316, the docetaxel-containing combination regimen TAC showed significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) than FAC (hazard ratio=0.74; 2-sided 95% CI=0.60, 0.92, stratified log rank p=0.0047).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe primary endpoint, disease-free survival, included local and distant recurrences, contralateral breast cancer and deaths from any cause.
HIGHLIGHTS The overall reduction in risk of relapse was 25.7% for TAC-treated patients.
(See Figure 1).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSAt the time of this interim analysis, based on 219 deaths, overall survival was longer for TAC than FAC (hazard ratio=0.69, 2-sided 95% CI=0.53, 0.90).
 (See Figure 2).

 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
 HIGHLIGHTSThe efficacy and safety of TAXOTERE has been evaluated in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has failed prior platinum-based chemotherapy or in patients who are chemotherapy-naive.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSMonotherapy with TAXOTERE for NSCLC Previously Treated with Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Two randomized, controlled trials established that a TAXOTERE dose of 75 mg/m2 was tolerable and yielded a favorable outcome in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (see below).
HIGHLIGHTS TAXOTERE at a dose of 100 mg/m2, however, was associated with unacceptable hematologic toxicity, infections, and treatment-related mortality and this dose should not be used [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.7), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSOne trial (TAX317), randomized patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, no history of taxane exposure, and an ECOG performance status  &#x2030; 2 to TAXOTERE or best supportive care.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe primary endpoint of the study was survival.
HIGHLIGHTS Patients were initially randomized to TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 or best supportive care, but early toxic deaths at this dose led to a dose reduction to TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2.
HIGHLIGHTS A total of 104 patients were randomized in this amended study to either TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 or best supportive care.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn a second randomized trial (TAX320), 373 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy, and an ECOG performance status  &#x2030; 2 were randomized to TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 , TAXOTERE 100 mg/m2 and a treatment in which the investigator chose either vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 repeated every 3 weeks or ifosfamide 2 g/m2 days 1-3 repeated every 3 weeks.
 HIGHLIGHTSForty percent of the patients in this study had a history of prior paclitaxel exposure.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe primary endpoint was survival in both trials.

 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSPatients treated with TAXOTERE at a dose of 75 mg/m2 experienced no deterioration in performance status and body weight relative to the comparator arms used in these trials.
 HIGHLIGHTSCombination Therapy with TAXOTERE for Chemotherapy-Naive NSCLC In a randomized controlled trial (TAX326), 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and no prior chemotherapy were randomized to receive one of three treatments:
HIGHLIGHTS TAXOTERE 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 over 30 to 60 minutes every 3 weeks; vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 administered over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks; or a combination of TAXOTERE and carboplatin.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival.
 HIGHLIGHTSTreatment with TAXOTERE+cisplatin did not result in a statistically significantly superior survival compared to vinorelbine+cisplatin (see table below).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio (adjusted for interim analysis and multiple comparisons) shows that the addition of TAXOTERE to cisplatin results in an outcome ranging from a 6% inferior to a 26% superior survival compared to the addition of vinorelbine to cisplatin.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe results of a further statistical analysis showed that at least (the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval) 62% of the known survival effect of vinorelbine when added to cisplatin (about a 2-month increase in median survival; Wozniak et al. JCO, 1998) was maintained.

 HIGHLIGHTSA multicenter, open-label, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAXOTERE for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who had not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease.
  HIGHLIGHTSA total of 445 patients with KPS &gt;70 were treated with either TAXOTERE (T) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) in combination with cisplatin (C) (75 mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (F) (750 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) or cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe demographic characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe median age was 55 years, 71% were male, 71% were Caucasian, 24% were 65 years of age or older, 19% had a prior curative surgery and 12% had palliative surgery.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 (with a range of 1-16) for the TCF arm compared to 4 (with a range of 1-12) for the CF arm.
Time to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint and was defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause within 12 weeks of the last evaluable tumor assessment or within 12 weeks of the first infusion of study drugs for patients with no evaluable tumor assessment after randomization.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe hazard ratio (HR) for TTP was 1.47 (CF/TCF, 95% CI: 1.19-1.83) with a significantly longer TTP (p=0.0004) in the TCF arm.
 HIGHLIGHTSApproximately 75% of patients had died at the time of this analysis.

  HIGHLIGHTSIn this study, 501 patients, with locally advanced SCCHN, and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, were randomized to one of two treatment arms.
 HIGHLIGHTS Patients on the TAXOTERE arm received TAXOTERE (T) 75 mg/m by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m administered as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion, followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m/day from day 1 to day 4.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.
 HIGHLIGHTS Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin (P) 100 mg/m as a 30-minute to three-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (F) 1000 mg/m/day from day 1 to day 5.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.
 HIGHLIGHTSAll patients in both treatment arms who did not have progressive disease were to receive 7 weeks of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) following induction chemotherapy 3 to 8 weeks after the start of the last cycle.
 HIGHLIGHTSDuring radiotherapy, carboplatin (AUC 1.5) was given weekly as a one-hour intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses.
 HIGHLIGHTSRadiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment using once daily fractionation (2 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 7 weeks for a total dose of 70-72 Gy).
 Surgery on the primary site of disease and/or neck could be considered at anytime following completion of CRT.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe primary efficacy endpoint, overall survival (OS), was significantly longer (log-rank test, p=0.0058) with the TAXOTERE-containing regimen compared to PF [median OS: 70.6 versus 30.1 months respectively, hazard ratio (HR)=0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.54 - 0.90].
