 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 5.1 Immediate Post-Injection Reaction
 Approximately 16% of patients exposed to COPAXONE 20 mg per mL in the 5 placebo-controlled trials compared to 4% of those on placebo, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to COPAXONE 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to none on placebo, experienced a constellation of symptoms immediately after injection that included at least two of the following: flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, constriction of the throat, and urticaria.
 In general, these symptoms have their onset several months after the initiation of treatment, although they may occur earlier, and a given patient may experience one or several episodes of these symptoms.
Whether or not any of these symptoms actually represent a specific syndrome is uncertain.
Typically, the symptoms were transient and self-limited and did not require treatment; however, there have been reports of patients with similar symptoms who received emergency medical care.
 Whether an immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanism mediates these episodes, or whether several similar episodes seen in a given patient have identical mechanisms, is unknown.
 5.2 Chest Pain
 Approximately 13% of COPAXONE 20 mg per mL patients in the 5 placebo-controlled studies compared to 6% of placebo patients, and approximately 2% of patients exposed to COPAXONE 40 mg per mL in a placebo-controlled trial compared to 1% of placebo patients, experienced at least one episode of transient chest pain.
While some of these episodes occurred in the context of the Immediate Post-Injection Reaction described above, many did not.
The temporal relationship of this chest pain to an injection was not always known.
The pain was usually transient, often unassociated with other symptoms, and appeared to have no clinical sequelae.
 Some patients experienced more than one such episode, and episodes usually began at least 1 month after the initiation of treatment.
The pathogenesis of this symptom is unknown.
 5.3 Lipoatrophy and Skin Necrosis
 At injection sites, localized lipoatrophy and, rarely, injection site skin necrosis may occur.
Lipoatrophy occurred in approximately 2% of patients exposed to COPAXONE 20 mg per mL in the 5 placebo-controlled trials compared to none on placebo, and 0.5% of patients exposed to COPAXONE 40 mg per mL in a single placebo-controlled trial and none on placebo.
 Skin necrosis has only been observed in the post-marketing setting.
Lipoatrophy may occur at various times after treatment onset (sometimes after several months) and is thought to be permanent.
There is no known therapy for lipoatrophy.
To assist in possibly minimizing these events, the patient should be advised to follow proper injection technique and to rotate injection sites with each injection.

 5.4 Potential Effects on Immune Response
 Because COPAXONE can modify immune response, it may interfere with immune functions.
For example, treatment with COPAXONE may interfere with the recognition of foreign antigens in a way that would undermine the body's tumor surveillance and its defenses against infection.
There is no evidence that COPAXONE does this, but there has not been a systematic evaluation of this risk.
Because COPAXONE is an antigenic material, it is possible that its use may lead to the induction of host responses that are untoward, but systematic surveillance for these effects has not been undertaken.
 Although COPAXONE is intended to minimize the autoimmune response to myelin, there is the possibility that continued alteration of cellular immunity due to chronic treatment with COPAXONE may result in untoward effects.
  Glatiramer acetate-reactive antibodies are formed in most patients receiving glatiramer acetate.
Studies in both the rat and monkey have suggested that immune complexes are deposited in the renal glomeruli.
Furthermore, in a controlled trial of 125 RRMS patients given COPAXONE 20 mg per mL, subcutaneously every day for 2 years, serum IgG levels reached at least 3 times baseline values in 80% of patients by 3 months of initiation of treatment.
 By 12 months of treatment, however, 30% of patients still had IgG levels at least 3 times baseline values, and 90% had levels above baseline by 12 months.
 The antibodies are exclusively of the IgG subtype and predominantly of the IgG-1 subtype.
 No IgE type antibodies could be detected in any of the 94 sera tested; nevertheless, anaphylaxis can be associated with the administration of most any foreign substance, and therefore, this risk cannot be excluded.
  6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
 Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials
 COPAXONE 20 mg per mL per day
 Among 563 patients treated with COPAXONE in blinded placebo-controlled trials, approximately 5% of the subjects discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction.
The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were: injection site reactions, dyspnea, urticaria, vasodilatation, and hypersensitivity.

 The most common adverse reactions were: injection site reactions, vasodilatation, rash, dyspnea, and chest pain.
 Table 1 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with COPAXONE 20 mg per mL in the placebo-controlled trials.
These signs and symptoms were numerically more common in patients treated with COPAXONE than in patients treated with placebo.
Adverse reactions were usually mild in intensity.

 Adverse reactions which occurred only in 4 to 5 more subjects in the COPAXONE group than in the placebo group (less than 1% difference), but for which a relationship to COPAXONE could not be excluded, were arthralgia and herpes simplex.
 Laboratory analyses were performed on all patients participating in the clinical program for COPAXONE.
Clinically-significant laboratory values for hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis were similar for both COPAXONE and placebo groups in blinded clinical trials.
In controlled trials one patient discontinued treatment due to thrombocytopenia (16 x109/L), which resolved after discontinuation of treatment.
 Data on adverse reactions occurring in the controlled clinical trials of COPAXONE 20 mg per mL were analyzed to evaluate differences based on sex.
 No clinically-significant differences were identified.
 Ninety-six percent of patients in these clinical trials were Caucasian.
 The majority of patients treated with COPAXONE were between the ages of 18 and 45.
 Consequently, data are inadequate to perform an analysis of the adverse reaction incidence related to clinically-relevant age subgroups.
 Other Adverse Reactions
 In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical reactions are presented.
Because the reports include reactions observed in open and uncontrolled premarketing studies (n= 979), the role of COPAXONE in their causation cannot be reliably determined.
Furthermore, variability associated

 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
  Interactions between COPAXONE and other drugs have not been fully evaluated.
 Results from existing clinical trials do not suggest any significant interactions of COPAXONE with therapies commonly used in MS patients, including the concurrent use of corticosteroids for up to 28 days.
COPAXONE has not been formally evaluated in combination with interferon beta.
 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 8.1 Pregnancy
 Pregnancy Category B.
 Administration of glatiramer acetate by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in no adverse effects on offspring development.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

 reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, COPAXONE should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
 In rats or rabbits receiving glatiramer acetate by subcutaneous injection during the period of organogenesis, no adverse effects on embryo-fetal development were observed at doses up to 37.5 mg/kg/day (18 and 36 times, respectively, the therapeutic human dose of 20 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis).
In rats receiving subcutaneous glatiramer acetate at doses of up to 36 mg/kg from day 15 of pregnancy throughout lactation, no significant effects on delivery or on offspring growth and development were observed.
 8.2 Labor and Delivery
 The effects of COPAXONE on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.
 8.3 Nursing Mothers
 It is not known if glatiramer acetate is excreted in human milk.
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when COPAXONE is administered to a nursing woman.
 8.4 Pediatric Use
 The safety and effectiveness of COPAXONE have not been established in patients under 18 years of age.
 8.5 Geriatric Use
 COPAXONE has not been studied in elderly patients.
 8.6 Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function
 The pharmacokinetics of glatiramer acetate in patients with impaired renal function have not been determined.
 11 DESCRIPTION
 Glatiramer acetate, the active ingredient of COPAXONE, consists of the acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides, containing four naturally occurring amino acids: L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine, and L-lysine with an average molar fraction of 0.141, 0.427, 0.095, and 0.338, respectively.
The average molecular weight of glatiramer acetate is 5,000 - 9,000 daltons.
 Glatiramer acetate is identified by specific antibodies.
 Chemically, glatiramer acetate is designated L-glutamic acid polymer with L-alanine, L-lysine and L-tyrosine, acetate (salt).
Its structural formula is:

 CAS - 147245-92-9
 COPAXONE is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow, sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for subcutaneous injection.
Each 1 mL of COPAXONE solution contains 20 mg or 40 mg of glatiramer acetate and the following inactive ingredient: 40 mg of mannitol.
 The pH of the solutions is approximately 5.5 to 7.0.
 The biological activity of glatiramer acetate is determined by its ability to block the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice.
 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 12.1 Mechanism of Action
 The mechanism(s) by which glatiramer acetate exerts its effects in patients with MS are not fully understood.
However, glatiramer acetate is thought to act by modifying immune processes that are believed to be responsible for the pathogenesis of MS.
This hypothesis is supported by findings of studies that have been carried out to explore the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a condition induced in animals through immunization against central nervous system derived material containing myelin and often used as an experimental animal model of MS.
Studies in animals and in vitro systems suggest that upon its administration, glatiramer acetate-specific suppressor T-cells are induced and activated in the periphery.
 Because glatiramer acetate can modify immune functions, concerns exist about its potential to alter naturally-occurring immune responses.
 There is no evidence that glatiramer acetate does this, but this has not been systematically evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
 12.3 Pharmacokinetics
 Results obtained in pharmacokinetic studies performed in humans (healthy volunteers) and animals support that a substantial fraction of the therapeutic dose delivered to patients subcutaneously is hydrolyzed locally.
 Larger fragments of glatiramer acetate can be recognized by glatiramer acetate-reactive antibodies.
 Some fraction of the injected material, either intact or partially hydrolyzed, is presumed to enter the lymphatic circulation, enabling it to reach regional lymph nodes, and some may enter the systemic circulation intact.

 In a 2-year carcinogenicity study, mice were administered up to 60 mg/kg/day glatiramer acetate by subcutaneous injection (up to 15 times the human therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis).
 No increase in systemic neoplasms was observed.
In males receiving the 60-mg/kg/day dose, there was an increased incidence of fibrosarcomas at the injection sites.
 These sarcomas were associated with skin damage precipitated by repetitive injections of an irritant over a limited skin area.
 In a 2-year carcinogenicity study, rats were administered up to 30 mg/kg/day glatiramer acetate by subcutaneous injection (up to 15 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg/m2 basis).
No increase in neoplasms was observed.
  Glatiramer acetate was not mutagenic in in vitro (Ames test, mouse lymphoma tk) assays.
Glatiramer acetate was clastogenic in two separate in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in cultured human lymphocytes but not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.
 When glatiramer acetate was administered by subcutaneous injection prior to and during mating (males and females) and throughout gestation and lactation (females) at doses up to 36 mg/kg/day (18 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg/m2 basis) no adverse effects were observed on reproductive or developmental parameters.
 14 CLINICAL STUDIES
 Evidence supporting the effectiveness of COPAXONE derives from five placebo-controlled trials, four of which used a COPAXONE dose of 20 mg per mL per day and one of which used a COPAXONE dose of 40 mg per mL three times per week.
 COPAXONE 20 mg per mL per day
 Study 1 was performed at a single center.
 Fifty patients were enrolled and randomized to receive daily doses of either COPAXONE, 20 mg per mL subcutaneously, or placebo (COPAXONE: n=25; placebo: n=25).
Patients were diagnosed with RRMS by standard criteria, and had had at least 2 exacerbations during the 2 years immediately preceding enrollment.
Patients were ambulatory, as evidenced by a score of no more than 6 on the Kurtzke Disability Scale Score (DSS), a standard scale ranging from 0-Normal to 10-Death due to MS.
A score of 6 is defined as one at which a patient is still ambulatory with assistance; a score of 7 means the patient must use a wheelchair.
  Patients were examined every 3 months for 2 years, as well as within several days of a presumed exacerbation.
To confirm an exacerbation, a blinded neurologist had to document objective neurologic signs, as well as document the existence of other criteria (e.g., the persistence of the neurological signs for at least 48 hours).

 The protocol-specified primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who remained exacerbation free for the 2 years of the trial, but two other important outcomes were also specified as endpoints:  the frequency of attacks during the trial, and the change in the number of attacks compared with the number which occurred during the previous 2 years.
 Table 3 presents the values of the three outcomes described above, as well as several protocol-specified secondary measures.
These values are based on the intent-to-treat population (i.e., all patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment and who had at least 1 on-treatment assessment):

 *Progression was defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the DSS, persisting for at least 3 consecutive months.
 Study 2 was a multicenter trial of similar design which was performed in 11 US centers.
A total of 251 patients (COPAXONE: n=125; placebo: n=126) were enrolled.
The primary outcome measure was the Mean 2-Year Relapse Rate.

 In both studies, COPAXONE exhibited a clear beneficial effect on relapse rate, and it is based on this evidence that COPAXONE is considered effective.
 In Study 3, 481 patients who had recently (within 90 days) experienced an isolated demyelinating event and who had lesions typical of multiple sclerosis on brain MRI were randomized to receive either COPAXONE 20 mg per mL (n=243) or placebo (n=238).
The primary outcome measure was time to development of a second exacerbation.
Patients were followed for up to three years or until they reached the primary endpoint.
Secondary outcomes were brain MRI measures, including number of new T2 lesions and T2 lesion volume.
 Time to development of a second exacerbation was significantly delayed in patients treated with COPAXONE compared to placebo (Hazard Ratio = 0.55; 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.77; Figure 1).
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of patients developing a relapse within 36 months were 42.9% in the placebo group and 24.7% in the COPAXONE group.

 Patients treated with COPAXONE demonstrated fewer new T2 lesions at the last observation (rate ratio 0.41; confidence interval 0.28 to 0.59; p &lt; 0.0001).
Additionally, baseline-adjusted T2 lesion volume at the last observation was lower for patients treated with COPAXONE (ratio of 0.89; confidence interval 0.84 to 0.94; p = 0.0001).
 Study 4 was a multinational study in which MRI parameters were used both as primary and secondary endpoints.
A total of 239 patients with RRMS (COPAXONE: n=119; and placebo: n=120) were randomized.
Inclusion criteria were similar to those in the second study with the additional criterion that patients had to have at least one Gd-enhancing lesion on the screening MRI.
The patients were treated in a double-blind manner for nine months, during which they underwent monthly MRI scanning.
The primary endpoint for the double-blind phase was the total cumulative number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions over the nine months.
Table 5 summarizes the results for the primary outcome measure monitored during the trial for the intent-totreat cohort.

 Study 5 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study with a total of 1404 patients with RRMS randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either COPAXONE 40 mg per mL (n=943) or placebo (n=461) three times a week for 12 months.
 Patients had a median of 2 relapses in the 2 years prior to screening and had not received any interferon-beta for at least 2 months prior to screening.
 Baseline EDSS scores ranged from 0 to 5.5 with a median of 2.5.
Neurological evaluations were performed at baseline, every three months, and at unscheduled visits for suspected relapse or early termination.
 MRI was performed at baseline, months 6 and 12, or early termination.
A total of 91% of those assigned to COPAXONE and 93% of those assigned to placebo completed treatment at 12 months.
 The primary outcome measure was the total number of confirmed relapses (persistence of neurological symptoms for at least 24 hours confirmed on examination with objective signs).
The effect of COPAXONE on several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables, including number of new or enlarging T2 lesions and number of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images, was also measured at months 6 and 12.

 Patient Information
 COPAXONE (co-PAX-own) (glatiramer acetate injection)
 for subcutaneous use
 Read this Patient Information before you start using COPAXONE and each time you get a refill.
There may be new information.
 This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.
 What is COPAXONE?
 COPAXONE is prescription medicine used for the treatment of people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).
  It is not known if COPAXONE is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age.
 Who should not use COPAXONE?
 &#x2022;  Do not use COPAXONE if you are allergic to glatiramer acetate, mannitol or any of the ingredients in COPAXONE.
See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of the ingredients in COPAXONE.
 What should I tell my doctor before using COPAXONE?
 Before you use COPAXONE, tell your doctor if you:

It is not known if COPAXONE
 will harm your unborn baby.
  &#x2022;  are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.
 It is not known if COPAXONE
 passes into your breast milk.
 Talk to your doctor about the best way to
 feed your baby while using COPAXONE.
  Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
 COPAXONE may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how COPAXONE works.
 Know the medicines you take.
 Keep a list of your medicines with you to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.
 How should I use COPAXONE?
 &#x2022; For detailed instructions, see the Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for complete information on how to use COPAXONE.
 &#x2022; Your doctor will tell you how much COPAXONE to use and when to use it.
&#x2022; COPAXONE is given by injection under your skin (subcutaneously).
  Reference ID: 3443331
                                                                                      NDA 020622/S-089 FDA Approved Labeling Text dated January 28, 2014
 &#x2022;  Use COPAXONE exactly as your doctor tells you to use it.
&#x2022;  Since every body type is different, talk with your doctor about the
 injection areas that are best for you.
 &#x2022;  You should receive your first dose of COPAXONE with a doctor or nurse
 present.
 This might be at your doctor's office or with a visiting home
 health nurse who will teach you how to give your COPAXONE injections.
  What are the possible side effects of COPAXONE?
 COPAXONE may cause serious side effects, including:
  &#x2022; Post-Injection Reactions.
Serious side effects may happen right after
 you inject COPAXONE at any time during your course of treatment.
 Call your doctor right away if you have any of these post-injection reaction symptoms including:
 &#x2022; redness to your cheeks or other parts of the body (flushing) &#x2022; chest pain &#x2022; fast heart beat &#x2022; anxiety &#x2022; breathing problems or tightness in your throat &#x2022; swelling, rash, hives, or itching
 If you have symptoms of a post-injection reaction, do not give yourself more injections until a doctor tells you to.
 &#x2022;  Chest Pain.
You can have chest pain as part of a post-injection reaction or by itself.
 This type of chest pain usually lasts a few minutes and can begin around 1 month after you start using COPAXONE.
 Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain while using COPAXONE.
 &#x2022;  Damage to your skin.
Damage to the fatty tissue just under your skin's surface (lipoatrophy) and, rarely, death of your skin tissue (necrosis) can happen when you use COPAXONE.
 Damage to the fatty tissue under your skin can cause a "dent" at the injection site that may not go away.
 You can reduce your chance of developing these problems by:
 &#x2022; following your doctor's instructions for how to use COPAXONE &#x2022; choosing a different injection area each time you use COPAXONE.
 See Step 4 in the Instructions for Use, "Choose your injection area".
 The most common side effects of COPAXONE include:
 &#x2022; skin problems at your injection site including: o  redness o  pain

 How do I inject COPAXONE?
 Step 1: Gather the supplies you will need to inject COPAXONE.
 See Figure A.
 &#x2022; 1 blister pack with a COPAXONE Prefilled Syringe with needle attached
 &#x2022; Alcohol wipe (not supplied)
 &#x2022; Dry cotton ball (not supplied)
 &#x2022; A place to record your injections, like a notebook (not supplied)
 &#x2022; Sharps disposal container (not supplied).
See Step 13 below,
 "Dispose of needles and syringes".
 Figure A
 Step 2: Remove only 1 blister pack from the COPAXONE prefilled syringe carton.
See Figure B.
 Figure B
 &#x2022;  Place the supplies you will need on a clean, flat surface in a well-lit area.
 &#x2022;  After you remove 1 blister pack from the carton, keep all unused syringes in the carton and store them in the refrigerator.
 &#x2022;  Let the blister pack, with the syringe inside, warm to room temperature for about 20 minutes.
 Reference ID: 3443331
                                         NDA 020622/S-089 FDA Approved Labeling Text dated January 28, 2014
 &#x2022;  Wash your hands.
Be careful not to touch your face or hair after
 washing your hands.
  Step 3: Look closely at your COPAXONE prefilled syringe.
  &#x2022;  There may be small air bubbles in the syringe.
 Do not try to push the air bubble from the syringe before giving your injection so you do not lose any medicine.
 &#x2022;  Check the liquid medicine in the syringe before you give your injection.
 The liquid in the syringe should look clear, and colorless, and may look slightly yellow.
If the liquid is cloudy or contains any particles, do not use the syringe and throw it away in a sharps disposal container.
See Step 13 below, "Dispose of needles and syringes."
 Step 4: Choose your injection area.
See Figure C.
 See the injection areas you should use on your body.
 Talk with your doctor about the injection areas that are best for you.
 &#x2022; The possible injection areas on your body include (See Figure C): o  your stomach area (abdomen) around the belly button o  the back of your upper arms o  upper hips (below your waist) o  your thighs (above your knees)
 Reference ID: 3443331
                                           NDA 020622/S-089 FDA Approved Labeling Text dated January 28, 2014
 Figure C
 &#x2022;  For each COPAXONE dose, choose a different injection area from 1 of the areas shown above.
See Figure C.
 &#x2022;  Do not stick the needle in the same place (site) more than 1 time each week.
Each injection area contains multiple injection sites for you to choose from.
 Avoid injecting in the same site over and over again.
 &#x2022;  Keep a record of the sites where you give your injection each day so you will remember where you already injected.
 Step 5: Prepare to give your injection.
 &#x2022;  There are some injection areas on your body that are hard to reach (like the back of your arm).
 You may need help from someone who has been instructed on how to give your injection if you cannot reach certain injection areas.
 &#x2022;  Do not inject in sites where the skin has scarring or "dents".
 Using scarred or dented skin for your injections may make your skin worse.
 Step 6: Clean your injection site.
 Reference ID: 3443331
                                                                                NDA 020622/S-089 FDA Approved Labeling Text dated January 28, 2014
 &#x2022; Clean the injection site using the alcohol wipe and allow your skin to air dry.
See Figure D.

 Step 13: Dispose of your needles and syringes.
 &#x2022;  Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use.
Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash.
 &#x2022;  If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:
 o  made of a heavy-duty plastic, o  can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without
 sharps being able to come out, o  upright and stable during use, o  leak-resistant, and o  properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the
 container.
 &#x2022;  When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container.
 There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes.
 For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal .
 &#x2022;  Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household
 trash unless your community guidelines permit this.
Do not recycle your
 used sharps disposal container.
