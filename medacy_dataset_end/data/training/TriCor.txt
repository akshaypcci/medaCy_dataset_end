 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSFULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS1.1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia
 HIGHLIGHTSTRICOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), Triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS1.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia
 HIGHLIGHTSTRICOR is also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.
HIGHLIGHTS Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention.
Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. &gt; 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS1.3 Important Limitations of Use
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg of TRICOR was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS2.1 General Considerations
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving TRICOR, and should continue this diet during treatment with TRICOR.
TRICOR tablets should be given with meals, thereby optimizing the bioavailability of the medication.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe initial treatment for dyslipidemia is dietary therapy specific for the type of lipoprotein abnormality.
 HIGHLIGHTSExcess body weight and excess alcoholic intake may be important factors in hypertriglyceridemia and should be addressed prior to any drug therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSPhysical exercise can be an important ancillary measure.
HIGHLIGHTS Diseases contributory to hyperlipidemia, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated.
 HIGHLIGHTSEstrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSLipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of TRICOR if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range.
 HIGHLIGHTSTherapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 160 mg once daily.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.2 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia
 HIGHLIGHTSThe initial dose of TRICOR is 160 mg once daily.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.3 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia
 HIGHLIGHTSThe initial dose is 54 to 160 mg per day.
 HIGHLIGHTSDosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe maximum dose is 160 mg once daily.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.4 Impaired Renal Function
 HIGHLIGHTSTreatment with TRICOR should be initiated at a dose of 54 mg per day in patients having mild to moderately impaired renal function, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe use of TRICOR should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS2.5 Geriatric Patients
 HIGHLIGHTSDose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
 HIGHLIGHTS54 mg yellow tablets, imprinted with the "a" logo and code identification letters "TA".
 HIGHLIGHTS160 mg white tablets, imprinted with the "a" logo and code identification letters "TC".
HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
 HIGHLIGHTSTRICOR is contraindicated in:
 HIGHLIGHTSpatients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTSpatients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTSpatients with preexisting gallbladder disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
 HIGHLIGHTSnursing mothers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]
 HIGHLIGHTSpatients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or fenofibric acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity
 HIGHLIGHTSThe effect of TRICOR on coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality has not been established.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Lipid (ACCORD Lipid) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled study of 5518 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background statin therapy treated with fenofibrate.
The mean duration of follow-up was 4.7 years.
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate plus statin combination therapy showed a non-significant 8% relative risk reduction in the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular disease death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.79-1.08) (p=0.32) as compared to statin monotherapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn a gender subgroup analysis, the hazard ratio for MACE in men receiving combination therapy versus statin monotherapy was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.99), and the hazard ratio for MACE in women receiving combination therapy versus statin monotherapy was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98-1.94) (interaction p=0.01).
The clinical significance of this subgroup finding is unclear.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study was a 5-year randomized, placebo-controlled study of 9795 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with fenofibrate.
Fenofibrate demonstrated a non-significant 11% relative reduction in the primary outcome of coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05, p=0.16) and a significant 11% reduction in the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events (HR 0.89 [0.80-0.99], p=0.04).
 HIGHLIGHTSThere was a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p=0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.90, 1.57], p=0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with fenofibrate as compared to placebo.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSBecause of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets), clofibrate, and gemfibrozil, the adverse findings in 4 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies with these other fibrate drugs may also apply to TRICOR.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post myocardial infarction of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was no difference in mortality seen between the clofibrate group and the placebo group.
 HIGHLIGHTSThere was however, a difference in the rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery between the two groups (3.0% vs. 1.8%).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional one year.
 HIGHLIGHTSThere was a statistically significant, higher age - adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p = &lt; 0.01).
 HIGHLIGHTSExcess mortality was due to a 33% increase in noncardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis appeared to confirm the higher risk of gallbladder disease seen in clofibrate-treated patients studied in the Coronary Drug Project.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe Helsinki Heart Study was a large (n=4081) study of middle-aged men without a history of coronary artery disease.
Subjects received either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward.
HIGHLIGHTS Total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil randomization group but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk G:P = .91-1.64).
 HIGHLIGHTSAlthough cancer deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group (p = 0.11), cancers (excluding basal cell carcinoma) were diagnosed with equal frequency in both study groups.
 HIGHLIGHTSDue to the limited size of the study, the relative risk of death from any cause was not shown to be different than that seen in the 9 year follow-up data from World Health Organization study (RR=1.29).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSA secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study enrolled middle-aged men excluded from the primary prevention study because of known or suspected coronary heart disease.
Subjects received gemfibrozil or placebo for 5 years.
 HIGHLIGHTSAlthough cardiac deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group, this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-5.05).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe rate of gallbladder surgery was not statistically significant between study groups, but did trend higher in the gemfibrozil group, (1.9% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.07).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.2 Skeletal Muscle
 HIGHLIGHTSFibrates increase the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSMyopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSPatients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.
 HIGHLIGHTSCPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and TRICOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy/myositis is suspected or diagnosed.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSData from observational studies indicate that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, in particular gemfibrozil, are co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin).
 HIGHLIGHTSThe combination should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.3 Liver Function
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate at doses equivalent to 107 mg to 160 mg TRICOR per day has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)].
In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSWhen transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe incidence of increases in transaminases related to fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related.
HIGHLIGHTS In an 8-week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 107 mg to 160 mg TRICOR per day and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 54 mg or less TRICOR per day, or placebo.
 HIGHLIGHTSHepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years.
In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with chronic active hepatitis.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSBaseline and regular periodic monitoring of liver function, including serum ALT (SGPT) should be performed for the duration of therapy with TRICOR, and therapy discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.4 Serum Creatinine
 HIGHLIGHTSElevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate.
These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe clinical significance of these observations is unknown.
Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking TRICOR.
 HIGHLIGHTSRenal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking TRICOR at risk for renal insufficiency such as the elderly and patients with diabetes.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.5 Cholelithiasis
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate, like clofibrate and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis.
HIGHLIGHTS If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated.
HIGHLIGHTS TRICOR therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.6 Coumarin Anticoagulants
 HIGHLIGHTSCaution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with TRICOR because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects in prolonging the Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR).
 HIGHLIGHTSTo prevent bleeding complications, frequent monitoring of PT/INR and dose adjustment of the anticoagulant are recommended until PT/INR has stabilized [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.7 Pancreatitis
 HIGHLIGHTSPancreatitis has been reported in patients taking fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and clofibrate.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis occurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.8 Hematologic Changes
 HIGHLIGHTSMild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following initiation of fenofibrate therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSHowever, these levels stabilize during long-term administration.
HIGHLIGHTS Thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported in individuals treated with fenofibrate.
 HIGHLIGHTSPeriodic monitoring of red and white blood cell counts are recommended during the first 12 months of TRICOR administration.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions
 HIGHLIGHTSAcute hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis requiring patient hospitalization and treatment with steroids have been reported in individuals treated with fenofibrates.
 HIGHLIGHTSUrticaria was seen in 1.1 vs. 0%, and rash in 1.4 vs. 0.8% of fenofibrate and placebo patients respectively in controlled trials.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.10 Venothromboembolic Disease
 HIGHLIGHTSIn the FIELD trial, pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were observed at higher rates in the fenofibrate- than the placebo-treated group.
 HIGHLIGHTSOf 9,795 patients enrolled in FIELD, there were 4,900 in the placebo group and 4,895 in the fenofibrate group.
 HIGHLIGHTSFor DVT, there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.074); and for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.022).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group experienced definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal pulmonary embolism or thrombophlebitis than the placebo group (5.2% vs. 3.3% at five years; p &lt; 0.01).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS5.11 Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels
 HIGHLIGHTSThere have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of severe decreases in HDL cholesterol levels (as low as 2 mg/dL) occurring in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe decrease in HDL-C is mirrored by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis decrease has been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is rapid and sustained.
The clinical significance of this decrease in HDL-C is unknown.
 HIGHLIGHTSIt is recommended that HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline, and fibrate therapy should not be re-initiated.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
 HIGHLIGHTSBecause clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSAdverse events reported by 2% or more of patients treated with fenofibrate (and greater than placebo) during the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, regardless of causality, are listed in Table 1 below.
 HIGHLIGHTSAdverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.0% of patients treated with fenofibrate and in 3.0% treated with placebo.
 HIGHLIGHTSIncreases in liver function tests were the most frequent events, causing discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment in 1.6% of patients in double-blind trials.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSTable 1.

** Significantly different from Placebo.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS6.2 Postmarketing Experience
 HIGHLIGHTSThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fenofibrate: myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, muscle spasm, hepatitis, cirrhosis, anemia, arthralgia, decreases in hemoglobin, decreases in hematocrit, white blood cell decreases, asthenia, and severely depressed HDL-cholesterol levels.
HIGHLIGHTS Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7.1 Coumarin Anticoagulants
 HIGHLIGHTSPotentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects has been observed with prolongation of the PT/INR.
 HIGHLIGHTSCaution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with TRICOR.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe dosage of the anticoagulants should be reduced to maintain the PT/INR at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications.
 HIGHLIGHTSFrequent PT/INR determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the PT/INR has stabilized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7.2 Immunosuppressants
 HIGHLIGHTSImmunosuppessants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including TRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe benefits and risks of using TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets) with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed and renal function monitored.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7.3 Bile Acid Binding Resins
 HIGHLIGHTSSince bile acid binding resins may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take TRICOR at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS7.4 Colchicine
 HIGHLIGHTSCases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.1 Pregnancy
 HIGHLIGHTSPregnancy Category C
 HIGHLIGHTSSafety in pregnant women has not been established.
 HIGHLIGHTSThere are no adequate and well controlled studies of fenofibrate in pregnant women.
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn female rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day of fenofibrate from 15 days prior to mating through weaning, maternal toxicity was observed at 0.3 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 14, 127, and 361 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6-15 during the period of organogenesis, adverse developmental findings were not observed at 14 mg/kg/day (less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2).
At higher multiples of human doses evidence of maternal toxicity was observed.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 15, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 18 during the period of organogenesis and allowed to deliver, aborted litters were observed at 150 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons: mg/m2).
HIGHLIGHTS No developmental findings were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (at less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21 (weaning), maternal toxicity was observed at less than 1 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m2 .
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.3 Nursing Mothers
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate should not be used in nursing mothers.
 HIGHLIGHTSA decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.4 Pediatric Use
 HIGHLIGHTSSafety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.5 Geriatric Use
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibric acid is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.
HIGHLIGHTS Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age.
 HIGHLIGHTSSince elderly patients have a higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTSElderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications.
 HIGHLIGHTSConsider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking TRICOR.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.6 Renal Impairment
 HIGHLIGHTSThe use of TRICOR should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4)].
 HIGHLIGHTSDose reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTSMonitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS8.7 Hepatic Impairment
 HIGHLIGHTSThe use of TRICOR has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS10 OVERDOSAGE
 HIGHLIGHTSThere is no specific treatment for overdose with TRICOR.
 HIGHLIGHTSGeneral supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status, should an overdose occur.
 HIGHLIGHTSIf indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.
 HIGHLIGHTSBecause fenofibric acid is highly bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis should not be considered.

 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTS12.1 Mechanism of Action
 HIGHLIGHTSThe active moiety of TRICOR is fenofibric acid.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe pharmacological effects of fenofibric acid in both animals and humans have been extensively studied through oral administration of fenofibrate.
 HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTSThe lipid-modifying effects of fenofibric acid seen in clinical practice have been explained in vivo in transgenic mice and in vitro in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  (PPAR).
 HIGHLIGHTSThrough this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe resulting decrease in TG produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles (which are thought to be atherogenic due to their susceptibility to oxidation), to large buoyant particles.
 HIGHLIGHTSThese larger particles have a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors and are catabolized rapidly.
 HIGHLIGHTSActivation of PPAR also induces an increase in the synthesis of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II and HDL-cholesterol.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate also reduces serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.2 Pharmacodynamics
 HIGHLIGHTSA variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, LDL-C, and apo B, an LDL membrane complex, are associated with human atherosclerosis.
 HIGHLIGHTSSimilarly, decreased levels of HDL-C and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A (apo AI and apo AII) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis.
 HIGHLIGHTSEpidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C, LDL-C, and TG, and inversely with the level of HDL-C.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering triglycerides (TG) on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSFenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, produces reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) in treated patients.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn addition, treatment with fenofibrate results in increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoproteins apoAI and apoAII.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS12.3 Pharmacokinetics
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibrate is a pro-drug of the active chemical moiety fenofibric acid.
Fenofibrate is converted by ester hydrolysis in the body to fenofibric acid which is the active constituent measurable in the circulation.
 HIGHLIGHTSAbsorption in the feces.
HIGHLIGHTS Peak plasma levels of fenofibric acid occur within 6 to 8 hours after administration.
 HIGHLIGHTSThe absorption of fenofibrate is increased when administered with food.
HIGHLIGHTS With fenofibrate tablets, the extent of absorption is increased by approximately 35% under fed as compared to fasting conditions.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSDistribution
 HIGHLIGHTSUpon multiple dosing of fenofibrate, fenofibric acid steady state is achieved within 5 days.
 HIGHLIGHTSPlasma concentrations of fenofibric acid at steady state are approximately double of those following a single dose.
 HIGHLIGHTSSerum protein binding was approximately 99% in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSMetabolism
 HIGHLIGHTSFollowing oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active metabolite, fenofibric acid; no unchanged fenofibrate is detected in plasma.
 HIGHLIGHTSFenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine.
 HIGHLIGHTSA small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn vivo metabolism data indicate that neither fenofibrate nor fenofibric acid undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSElimination
 HIGHLIGHTSAfter absorption, fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites, primarily fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide.
 HIGHLIGHTSAfter administration of radiolabelled fenofibrate, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in the urine and 25% was excreted in the feces.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSFenofibric acid is eliminated with a half-life of 20 hours, allowing once daily dosing.
 HIGHLIGHTSSpecial Populations
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSGeriatrics
 HIGHLIGHTSIn elderly volunteers 77 to 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults.
 HIGHLIGHTSThis indicates that a similar dosage regimen can be used in elderly with normal renal function, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
 HIGHLIGHTSPediatrics
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe pharmacokinetics of TRICOR has not been studied in pediatric populations.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSGender
 HIGHLIGHTSNo pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibrate.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSRace
 HIGHLIGHTSThe influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been studied, however fenofibrate is not metabolized by enzymes known for exhibiting inter-ethnic variability.
 HIGHLIGHTSRenal Impairment
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThe pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid was examined in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2) showed 2.7-fold increase in exposure for fenofibric acid and increased accumulation of fenofibric acid during chronic dosing compared to that of healthy subjects.
 HIGHLIGHTSPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2) had similar exposure but an increase in the half-life for fenofibric acid compared to that of healthy subjects.
 HIGHLIGHTSBased on these findings, the use of TRICOR should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment and dose reduction is required in patients having mild to moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSHepatic Impairment
 HIGHLIGHTSNo pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSDrug-drug Interactions
 HIGHLIGHTSIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that fenofibrate and fenofibric acid are not inhibitors of cytochrome (CYP) P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSThey are weak inhibitors of CYP2C8, CYP2C19 and CYP2A6, and mild-to-moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9 at therapeutic concentrations.

 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 HIGHLIGHTS13.1 Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility
 HIGHLIGHTSTwo dietary carcinogenicity studies have been conducted in rats with fenofibrate.
HIGHLIGHTS In the first 24month study, Wistar rats were dosed with fenofibrate at 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3, 1, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m2).
HIGHLIGHTS At a dose of 200 mg/kg/day (at 6 times the MRHD), the incidence of liver carcinomas was significantly increased in both sexes.
 HIGHLIGHTSA statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males at 1 and 6 times the MRHD; an increase in pancreatic adenomas and benign testicular interstitial cell tumors was observed at 6 times the MRHD in males.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn a second 24-month rat carcinogenicity study in a different strain of rats (Sprague-Dawley), doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD) produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes and increases in testicular interstitial cell tumors in males at 2 times the MRHD.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSA 117-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats comparing three drugs: fenofibrate 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD), clofibrate (400 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose), and gemfibrozil (250 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose, based on mg/m2 surface area).
HIGHLIGHTS Fenofibrate increased pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes.
 HIGHLIGHTSClofibrate increased hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar adenomas in males and hepatic neoplastic nodules in females.
 HIGHLIGHTSGemfibrozil increased hepatic neoplastic nodules in males and females, while all three drugs increased testicular interstitial cell tumors in males.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSIn a 21-month study in CF-1 mice, fenofibrate 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2, 1, and 3 times the MRHD on the basis of mg/m2 surface area) significantly increased the liver carcinomas in both sexes at 3 times the MRHD.
 HIGHLIGHTSIn a second 18-month study at 10, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day, fenofibrate significantly increased the liver carcinomas in male mice and liver adenomas in female mice at 3 times the MRHD.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSElectron microscopy studies have demonstrated peroxisomal proliferation following fenofibrate administration to the rat.
 HIGHLIGHTSAn adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation in humans has not been done, but changes in peroxisome morphology and numbers have been observed in humans after treatment with other members of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSMutagenesis: Fenofibrate has been demonstrated to be devoid of mutagenic potential in the following tests: Ames, mouse lymphoma, chromosomal aberration and unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes.
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTSImpairment of Fertility: In fertility studies rats were given oral dietary doses of fenofibrate, males received 61 days prior to mating and females 15 days prior to mating through weaning which resulted in no adverse effect on fertility at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (~10 times the MRHD, based on mg/m2 surface area comparisons).
 HIGHLIGHTS HIGHLIGHTS14 CLINICAL STUDIES
 HIGHLIGHTS14.1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia
 HIGHLIGHTSThe effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets) per day were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL.
TRICOR therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.
