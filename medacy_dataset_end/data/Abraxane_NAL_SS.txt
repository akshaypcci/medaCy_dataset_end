 2.5 Dose Reduction/Discontinuation Recommendations
 Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during ABRAXANE therapy should have dosage reduced to 220 mg/m2 for subsequent courses of ABRAXANE.
 For recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/m2 .
For Grade 3 sensory neuropathy hold treatment until resolution to Grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of ABRAXANE [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer &#x201a; Do not administer ABRAXANE on Day 1 of a cycle until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet
 count is at least 100,000 cells/mm3 [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
&#x201a; In patients who develop severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia withhold treatment until counts recover to an absolute neutrophil
 count of at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm3 on Day 1 or to an absolute neutrophil count of at least 500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of at least 50,000 cells/mm3 on Days 8 or 15 of the cycle.
 Upon resumption of dosing, permanently reduce ABRAXANE and carboplatin doses as outlined in Table 2.
 &#x201a; Withhold ABRAXANE for Grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy.
 Resume ABRAXANE and carboplatin at reduced doses (see Table 2) when peripheral neuropathy improves to Grade 1 or completely resolves [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

 2.6 Preparation and Administration Precautions ABRAXANE is a cytotoxic drug and, as with other potentially toxic paclitaxel compounds, caution should be exercised in handling ABRAXANE.
The use of gloves is recommended.
If ABRAXANE (lyophilized cake or reconstituted suspension) contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water.
 Following topical exposure to paclitaxel, events may include tingling, burning and redness.
If ABRAXANE contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water.
 Reference ID: 3656415 5
                                                                    Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.
Limiting the infusion of ABRAXANE to 30 minutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.4)].
 Premedication to prevent hypersensitivity reactions is generally not needed prior to the administration of ABRAXANE.
 Premedication may be needed in patients who have had prior hypersensitivity reactions to ABRAXANE.
 Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE should not be re-challenged with this drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].
 2.7 Preparation for Intravenous Administration  ABRAXANE is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution before use.
AVOID ERRORS, READ ENTIRE PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS PRIOR TO RECONSTITUTION.
 1.
  Aseptically, reconstitute each vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.
 2.
  Slowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 1 minute, using the sterile syringe to direct the solution flow onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL.
 3.
  DO NOT INJECT the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, directly onto the lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming.
 4.
  Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.
 5.
  Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution of any cake/powder occurs.
Avoid generation of foam.
 6.
  If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides.
 Each mL of the reconstituted formulation will contain 5 mg/mL paclitaxel.
 Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL suspension required for the patient: Dosing volume (mL) = Total dose (mg)/5 (mg/mL).
 The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible particulates.
 If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use.
 Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed.
 Discard any unused portion.
 Inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted ABRAXANE into an empty, sterile intravenous bag [plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containers, PVC or non-PVC type intravenous bag].
 The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or administer ABRAXANE infusions.
 The use of an in-line filter is not recommended.
 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
 2.8 Stability Unopened vials of ABRAXANE are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored between 20C to 25C (68F to 77F) in the original package.
Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product.
 Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Vial Reconstituted ABRAXANE in the vial should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) for a maximum of 24 hours if necessary.
If not used immediately, each vial of reconstituted suspension should be replaced in the original carton to protect it from bright light.
Discard any unused portion.
 Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Infusion Bag The suspension for infusion when prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F) and protected from bright light for a maximum of 24 hours.
  The total combined refrigerated storage time of reconstituted ABRAXANE in the vial and in the infusion bag is 24 hours.
This may be followed by storage in the infusion bag at ambient temperature (approximately 25C) and lighting conditions for a maximum of 4 hours.
 Discard any unused portion.

 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS &#x201a; ABRAXANE should not be used in patients who have baseline neutrophil counts of &lt; 1,500 cells/mm3 .
&#x201a; Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE should not be rechallenged with the drug.
 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
 5.1 Hematologic Effects Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity of ABRAXANE.
 In clinical studies, Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 34% of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), 47% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 38% of patients with pancreatic cancer.
 Monitor for myelotoxicity by performing complete blood cell counts frequently, including prior to dosing on Day 1 (for MBC) and Days 1, 8, and 15 (for NSCLC and for pancreatic cancer).
 Do not administer ABRAXANE to patients with baseline absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of less than 1,500 cells/mm3 .
In the case of severe neutropenia (&lt;500 cells/mm3 for seven days or more) during a course of ABRAXANE therapy, reduce the dose of ABRAXANE in subsequent courses in patients with either MBC or NSCLC.
 In patients with MBC, resume treatment with every-3-week cycles of ABRAXANE after ANC recovers to a level &gt;1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to a level &gt;100,000 cells/mm3 .
 In patients with NSCLC, resume treatment if recommended (see Dosage and Administration, Table 2) at permanently reduced doses for both weekly ABRAXANE and every-3-week carboplatin after ANC recovers to at least 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm3 on Day 1 or to an ANC of at least 500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of at least 50,000 cells/mm3 on Days 8 or 15 of the cycle [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
 In patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, withhold ABRAXANE and gemcitabine if the ANC is less than 500 cells/mm3 or platelets are less than 50,000 cells/mm3 and delay initiation of the next cycle if the ANC is less than 1500 cells/mm3 or platelet count is less than 100,000 cells/mm3 on Day 1 of the cycle.
 Resume treatment with appropriate dose reduction if recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
 5.2 Nervous System Sensory neuropathy is dose- and schedule-dependent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3)].
The occurrence of Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose modification.
 If &#x2265; Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, withhold ABRAXANE treatment until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 for metastatic breast cancer or until resolution to &#x2264; Grade 1 for NSCLC and pancreatic cancer followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of ABRAXANE [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
 5.3 Sepsis Sepsis occurred in 5% of patients with or without neutropenia who received ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine.
 Biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent were risk factors for severe or fatal sepsis.
 If a patient becomes febrile (regardless of ANC) initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics.
 For febrile neutropenia, interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC &#x2265; 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
5.4 Pneumonitis Pneumonitis, including some cases that were fatal, occurred in 4% of patients receiving ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine.
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine during evaluation of suspected pneumonitis.
 After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with ABRAXANE and gemcitabine.
 5.5 Hypersensitivity Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported.
 Patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE should not be re-challenged with this drug.
 5.6 Hepatic Impairment Because the exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic impairment, administration of ABRAXANE in patients with hepatic impairment should be performed with caution.
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression; such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression.
ABRAXANE is not recommended in patients who have total bilirubin &gt;5 x ULN or AST &gt;10 x ULN.
In addition, ABRAXANE is not recommended in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN and AST &#x2264;10 x ULN).
The starting dose should be reduced for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 5.7 Albumin (Human) ABRAXANE contains albumin (human), a derivative of human blood.
Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries a remote risk for transmission of viral diseases.
 A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

                                                                                      (CJD) also is considered extremely remote.
 No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin.
 5.8 Use in Pregnancy ABRAXANE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
 Administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles to rats during pregnancy at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area, caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions, reduced numbers of live fetuses, and malformations.
 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women receiving ABRAXANE.
 If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
 Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving ABRAXANE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
 5.9 Use in Men Men should be advised not to father a child while receiving ABRAXANE [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
 The most common adverse reactions (&#x2265; 20%) with single-agent use of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer are alopecia, neutropenia, sensory neuropathy, abnormal ECG, fatigue/asthenia, myalgia/arthralgia, AST elevation, alkaline phosphatase elevation, anemia, nausea, infections, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 The most common adverse reactions (&#x2265; 20%) of ABRAXANE in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer are anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and fatigue [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] The most common serious adverse reactions of ABRAXANE in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer are anemia (4%) and pneumonia (3%).

 Adverse Event Experiences by Body System
 Hematologic Disorders Neutropenia was dose dependent and reversible.
 Among patients with metastatic breast cancer in the randomized trial, neutrophil counts declined below 500 cells/mm3 (Grade 4) in 9% of the patients treated with a dose of 260 mg/m2 compared to 22% in patients receiving paclitaxel injection at a dose of 175 mg/m2 .
Pancytopenia has been observed in clinical trials.
 Reference ID: 3656415 9
                                                              Infections Infectious episodes were reported in 24% of the patients treated with ABRAXANE.
 Oral candidiasis, respiratory tract infections and pneumonia were the most frequently reported infectious complications.
 Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSRs) Grade 1 or 2 HSRs occurred on the day of ABRAXANE administration and consisted of dyspnea (1%) and flushing, hypotension, chest pain, and arrhythmia (all &lt;1%).
 The use of ABRAXANE in patients previously exhibiting hypersensitivity to paclitaxel injection or human albumin has not been studied.
 Cardiovascular Hypotension, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in 5% of patients.
Bradycardia, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in &lt;1% of patients.
These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither specific therapy nor treatment discontinuation.
 Severe cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent ABRAXANE occurred in approximately 3% of patients.
 These events included cardiac ischemia/infarction, chest pain, cardiac arrest, supraventricular tachycardia, edema, thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary emboli, and hypertension.
 Cases of cerebrovascular attacks (strokes) and transient ischemic attacks have been reported.
 Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among patients at baseline.
 ECG abnormalities on study did not usually result in symptoms, were not dose-limiting, and required no intervention.
 ECG abnormalities were noted in 60% of patients.
 Among patients with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 35% of all patients developed an abnormal tracing while on study.
 The most frequently reported ECG modifications were non-specific repolarization abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, and sinus tachycardia.
 Respiratory Dyspnea (12%), cough (7%), and pneumothorax (&lt;1%) were reported after treatment with ABRAXANE.
 Neurologic The frequency and severity of sensory neuropathy increased with cumulative dose.
 Sensory neuropathy was the cause of ABRAXANE discontinuation in 7/229 (3%) patients.
 Twenty-four patients (10%) treated with ABRAXANE developed Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy; of these patients, 14 had documented improvement after a median of 22 days; 10 patients resumed treatment at a reduced dose of ABRAXANE and 2 discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy.
 Of the 10 patients without documented improvement, 4 discontinued the study due to peripheral neuropathy.
 No Grade 4 sensory neuropathies were reported.
 Only one incident of motor neuropathy (Grade 2) was observed in either arm of the controlled trial.
 Vision Disorders Ocular/visual disturbances occurred in 13% of all patients (n=366) treated with ABRAXANE and 1% were severe.
 The severe cases (keratitis and blurred vision) were reported in patients who received higher doses than those recommended (300 or 375 mg/m2).
These effects generally have been reversible.
 Arthralgia/Myalgia The symptoms were usually transient, occurred two or three days after ABRAXANE administration, and resolved within a few days.
 Hepatic Grade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT were reported for 14% of patients treated with ABRAXANE and 10% of patients treated with paclitaxel injection in the randomized trial.
 Renal Overall 11% of patients experienced creatinine elevation, 1% severe.
 No discontinuations, dose reductions, or dose delays were caused by renal toxicities.
 Other Clinical Events Nail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) have been reported.
 Edema occurred in 10% of patients; no patients had severe edema.
 Dehydration and pyrexia were also reported.
 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Adverse reactions were assessed in 514 ABRAXANE/carboplatin-treated patients and 524 paclitaxel injection/carboplatin-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment for locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial.
 ABRAXANE was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle.
 Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m2, following premedication.
 In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg&#x2022;min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of ABRAXANE/paclitaxel infusion.
The differences in paclitaxel dose and schedule between the two arms limit direct comparison of dose- and schedule-dependent adverse reactions.
 Among patients evaluable for adverse reactions, the median age was 60 years, 75% were men, 81% were White, 49% had adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung cancer, 76% were ECOG PS 1.
 Patients in both treatment arms received a median of 6 cycles of treatment.

 Infections &amp; infestations: oral candidiasis, pneumonia Vascular disorders: hypertension Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, congestive cardiac failure Eye disorders: cystoid macular edema
 Peripheral Neuropathy Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 17% of patients who received ABRAXANE/gemcitabine compared to 1% of patients who received gemcitabine only; no patients developed grade 4 peripheral neuropathy.
 The median time to first occurrence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the ABRAXANE arm was 140 days.
 Upon suspension of ABRAXANE dosing, the median time to improvement from Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy to &#x2264; Grade 1 was 29 days.
Of ABRAXANE-treated patients with Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, 44% resumed ABRAXANE at a reduced dose.
 Sepsis Sepsis occurred in 5% of patients who received ABRAXANE/gemcitabine compared to 2% of patients who received gemcitabine alone.
Sepsis occurred both in patients with and without neutropenia.
 Risk factors for sepsis included biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent.
 Pneumonitis Pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients who received ABRAXANE/gemcitabine compared to 1% of patients who received gemcitabine alone.
Two of 17 patients in the ABRAXANE arm with pneumonitis died.
 6.4 Post-Marketing Experience with ABRAXANE and other Paclitaxel Formulations Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion refers to the adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of ABRAXANE.
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 In some instances, severe events observed with paclitaxel injection may be expected to occur with ABRAXANE.
 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ABRAXANE.
 The use of ABRAXANE in patients previously exhibiting hypersensitivity to paclitaxel injection or human albumin has not been studied.
 Cardiovascular There have been reports of congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and atrioventricular block with ABRAXANE.
 Most of the individuals were previously exposed to cardiotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, or had underlying cardiac history.
 Respiratory There have been reports of pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary embolism in patients receiving ABRAXANE and reports of radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy.
 Reports of lung fibrosis have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of paclitaxel injection safety and may also be observed with ABRAXANE.
 Neurologic Cranial nerve palsies and vocal cord paresis have been reported, as well as autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus.
 Vision Disorders Reports in the literature of abnormal visual evoked potentials in patients treated with paclitaxel injection suggest persistent optic nerve damage.
These may also be observed with ABRAXANE.
 Reduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported during treatment with ABRAXANE as well as with other taxanes.
After cessation of treatment, CME improves and visual acuity may return to baseline.
 Hepatic Reports of hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of paclitaxel injection safety and may occur following ABRAXANE treatment.
 Reference ID: 3656415 13
                                                              Gastrointestinal (GI) There have been reports of intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, and ischemic colitis following ABRAXANE treatment.
There have been reports of neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis), despite the coadministration of G-CSF, occurring in patients treated with paclitaxel injection alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
 Injection Site Reaction There have been reports of extravasation of ABRAXANE.
 Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to monitor closely the ABRAXANE infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.
 Severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, necrosis, and fibrosis have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of paclitaxel injection safety.
 In some cases the onset of the injection site reaction in paclitaxel injection patients either occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed by a week to ten days.
 Recurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel injection at a different site, i.e., &#x20ac;&#x153;recall&#x20ac;&#xfffd;, has been reported.
 Other Clinical Events Skin reactions including generalized or maculopapular rash, erythema, and pruritus have been observed with ABRAXANE.
 There have been case reports of photosensitivity reactions, radiation recall phenomenon, and in some patients previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.
 Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported.
 There have been reports of conjunctivitis, cellulitis, and increased lacrimation with paclitaxel injection.
 6.5 Accidental Exposure No reports of accidental exposure to ABRAXANE have been received.
 However, upon inhalation of paclitaxel, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea have been reported.
 Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning, and redness.
 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.
 Caution should be exercised when administering ABRAXANE concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit (e.g., ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) or induce (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, and nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.
 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
 There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using ABRAXANE.
 Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ABRAXANE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
 If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving ABRAXANE.
 Administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles to rats during pregnancy, on gestation days 7 to 17 at doses of 6 mg/m2 (approximately 2% of the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis) caused embryofetal toxicities, as indicated by intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions (up to 5-fold), reduced numbers of litters and live fetuses, reduction in fetal body weight and increase in fetal anomalies.
 Fetal anomalies included soft tissue and skeletal malformations, such as eye bulge, folded retina, microphthalmia, and dilation of brain ventricles.
 A lower incidence of soft tissue and skeletal malformations were also exhibited at 3 mg/m2 (approximately 1% of the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis).
 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether paclitaxel is excreted in human milk.
Paclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats.
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ABRAXANE in pediatric patients have not been evaluated.
 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 229 patients in the randomized study who received ABRAXANE for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 13% were at least 65 years of age and &lt; 2% were 75 years or older.
 No toxicities occurred notably more frequently among patients who received ABRAXANE.
 Of the 514 patients in the randomized study who received ABRAXANE and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, 31% were 65 years or older and 3.5% were 75 years or older.
 Myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and arthralgia were more frequent in patients 65 years or older compared to patients younger than 65 years old.
 No overall difference in effectiveness, as measured by response rates, was observed between patients 65 years or older compared to patients younger than 65 years old.
 Reference ID: 3656415 14
                                                       Of the 431 patients in the randomized study who received ABRAXANE and gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 41% were 65 years or older and 10% were 75 years or older.
 No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients who were 65 years of age or older and younger patients.
 Diarrhea, decreased appetite, dehydration and epistaxis were more frequent in patients 65 years or older compared with patients younger than 65 years old.
 Clinical studies of ABRAXANE did not include sufficient number of patients with pancreatic cancer who were 75 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.
 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The exposure to paclitaxel may be higher in patients with hepatic impairment than in patients with normal hepatic function.
 Reduce ABRAXANE starting dose in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
 Do not administer ABRAXANE to patients with total bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or AST &gt; 10 x ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Do not administer to patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
 8.7 Patients with Renal Impairment Adjustment of the starting ABRAXANE dose is not required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance &#x2265;30 to &lt;90 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
There are insufficient data to permit dosage recommendations in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min).
 10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for ABRAXANE overdosage.
 The primary anticipated complications of overdosage would consist of bone marrow suppression, sensory neurotoxicity, and mucositis.
 11 DESCRIPTION ABRAXANE for Injectable Suspension (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) is paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound nanoparticles with a mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers.
Paclitaxel exists in the particles in a non-crystalline, amorphous state.
ABRAXANE is supplied as a white to yellow, sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to intravenous infusion.
Each single-use vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel (bound to human albumin) and approximately 900 mg of human albumin (containing sodium caprylate and sodium acetyltryptophanate).
Each milliliter (mL) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles.
ABRAXANE is free of solvents.
 The active agent in ABRAXANE is paclitaxel, a microtubule inhibitor.
 The chemical name for paclitaxel is 5,20-Epoxy1,2,4,7,10,13-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2R,3S)-N-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine.
Paclitaxel has the following structural formula:
 Paclitaxel is a white to off-white crystalline powder with the empirical formula C47H51NO14 and a molecular weight of 853.91.
 It is highly lipophilic, insoluble in water, and melts at approximately 216C to 217C.
 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
 12.1 Mechanism of Action ABRAXANE is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization.
 This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions.
Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or "bundles" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.
 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30 and 180-minute infusions of ABRAXANE at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/m2 were determined in clinical studies.
 Dose levels of mg/m2 refer to mg of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE.
Following intravenous administration of ABRAXANE, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner, the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination.
 Reference ID: 3656415 15
                                                            The drug exposure (AUCs) was dose proportional over 80 to 300 mg/m2 and the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel for ABRAXANE were independent of the duration of intravenous administration.
 The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg/m2 ABRAXANE administered over a 30-minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel injection over a 3-hour infusion.
Clearance was larger (43%) and the volume of distribution was higher (53%) for ABRAXANE than for paclitaxel injection.
There were no differences in terminal half-lives.
 Distribution Following ABRAXANE administration to patients with solid tumors, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%).
In a within-patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was significantly higher with ABRAXANE (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%).
This contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with ABRAXANE compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable.
In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 g/mL, indicated that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.
The total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel.
 Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel was metabolized primarily to 6&#x3b1;hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8; and to two minor metabolites, 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6&#x3b1;, 3'-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4.
In vitro, the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6&#x3b1;-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses.
Testosterone, 17&#x3b1;-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6&#x3b1;-hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro.
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 [see Drug Interactions (7)].
 Elimination At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m2, the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 30 L/h/m2, and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours.
 After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg/m2 doses of ABRAXANE, the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug (4%) indicated extensive non-renal clearance.
 Less than 1% of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6&#x3b1;-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3'-p-hydroxypaclitaxel.
Fecal excretion was approximately 20% of the total dose administered.
 Specific Populations
 Pharmacokinetics in Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following ABRAXANE administration was studied in patients with advanced solid tumors.
The results showed that mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt;1 to &#x2264;1.5 x ULN, AST &#x2264;10 x ULN, n=8) had no clinically important effect on pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel.
 Patients with moderate (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 to &#x2264; 3 x ULN, AST &#x2264;10 x ULN, n=7) or severe (total bilirubin &gt;3 to &#x2264;5 x ULN, n=5) hepatic impairment had a 22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in mean paclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin &#x2264;ULN, AST &#x2264;ULN, n=130).
[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Elimination of paclitaxel shows an inverse correlation with total bilirubin and a positive correlation with serum albumin.
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that there is no correlation between hepatic function (as indicated by the baseline albumin or total bilirubin level) and neutropenia after adjusting for ABRAXANE exposure.
Pharmacokinetic data are not available for patients with total bilirubin &gt;5 x ULN or for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
 Pharmacokinetics in Renal Impairment The effect of pre-existing mild (creatinine clearance &#x2265;60 to &lt;90 mL/min, n=61) or moderate (creatinine clearance &#x2265;30 to &lt;60 mL/min, n=23) renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following ABRAXANE administration was studied in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Mild to moderate renal impairment had no clinically important effect on the maximum elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
 Other Intrinsic Factors Population pharmacokinetic analyses for ABRAXANE show that body weight (40 to 143 kg), body surface area (1.3 to 2.4 m2), gender, race (Asian vs. White), age (24 to 85 years) and type of solid tumors do not have a clinically important effect on the maximum elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel.
 Pharmacokinetic Interactions between  ABRAXANE and Carboplatin Administration of carboplatin immediately after the completion of the ABRAXANE infusion to patients with NSCLC did not cause clinically meaningful changes in paclitaxel exposure.
 The observed mean AUCinf of free carboplatin was approximately 23% higher than the targeted value (6 min*mg/mL), but its mean half-life and clearance were consistent with those reported in the absence of paclitaxel.
 Reference ID: 3656415 16
                                                                              Pharmacokinetic Interactions between  ABRAXANE and Gemcitabine Pharmacokinetic interactions between ABRAXANE and gemcitabine have not been studied in humans.
 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of ABRAXANE has not been studied.
 Paclitaxel was clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice).
ABRAXANE was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay.
 Administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles to male rats at 42 mg/m2 on a weekly basis (approximately 16% of the daily maximum recommended human exposure on a body surface area basis) for 11 weeks prior to mating with untreated female rats resulted in significantly reduced fertility accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females.
A low incidence of skeletal and soft tissue fetal anomalies was also observed at doses of 3 and 12 mg/m2/week in this study (approximately 1 to 5% of the daily maximum recommended human exposure on a mg/m2 basis).
Testicular atrophy/degeneration was observed in single-dose toxicology studies in rodents administered paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles at doses lower than the recommended human dose; doses were 54 mg/m2 in rodents and 175 mg/m2 in dogs.
 14 CLINICAL STUDIES
 14.1 Metastatic Breast Cancer Data from 106 patients accrued in two single arm open label studies and from 460 patients enrolled in a randomized comparative study were available to support the use of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer.
 Single Arm Open Label Studies In one study, ABRAXANE was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
The second trial utilized a dose of 300 mg/m2 as a 30-minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
 Cycles were administered at 3-week intervals.
 Objective responses were observed in both studies.
 Randomized Comparative Study This multicenter trial was conducted in 460 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
 Patients were randomized to receive ABRAXANE at a dose of 260 mg/m2 given as a 30-minute infusion, or paclitaxel injection at 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour infusion.
 Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had visceral metastases; and 76% had &gt; 3 sites of metastases.
 Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting, 40% in the metastatic setting and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings.
 Fifty-nine percent received study drug as second or greater than second-line therapy.
 Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines.
 In this trial, patients in the ABRAXANE treatment arm had a statistically significantly higher reconciled target lesion response rate (the trial primary endpoint) of 21.5% (95% CI: 16.2% to 26.7%), compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 6.9% to 15.1%) for patients in the paclitaxel injection treatment arm.
See Table 11.
There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms.

 ABRAXANE was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle.
 Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m2, following premedication.
 In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg&#x2022;min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of ABRAXANE/paclitaxel infusion.
 Treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an unacceptable toxicity.
 The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate as determined by a central independent review committee using RECIST guidelines (Version 1.0).
 In the intent-to-treat (all-randomized) population, the median age was 60 years, 75% were men, 81% were White, 49% had adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung cancer, 76% were ECOG PS 1, and 73% were current or former smokers.
  Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment in both study arms.
 Patients in the ABRAXANE/carboplatin arm had a statistically significantly higher overall response rate compared to patients in the paclitaxel injection/carboplatin arm [(33% versus 25%) see Table 12].
 There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms.

 14.3 Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas A multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study was conducted in 861 patients comparing ABRAXANE plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
 Key eligibility criteria were Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &#x2265;70, normal bilirubin level, transaminase levels &#x2264; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or &#x2264; 5 times the ULN for patients with liver metastasis, no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting or for metastatic disease, no ongoing active infection requiring systemic therapy, and no history of interstitial lung disease.
 Patients with rapid decline in KPS (&#x2265;10%) or serum albumin (&#x2265;20%) during the 14 day screening period prior to study randomization were ineligible.
A total of 861 patients were randomized (1:1) to the ABRAXANE/gemcitabine arm (N=431) or to the gemcitabine arm (N=430).
 Randomization was stratified by geographic region (Australia, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, or North America), KPS (70 to 80 versus 90 to 100), and presence of liver metastasis (yes versus no).
 Patients randomized to ABRAXANE/gemcitabine received ABRAXANE 125 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
 Patients randomized to gemcitabine received 1000 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30-40 minutes weekly for 7 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period in Cycle 1 then as 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each subsequent 28-day cycle.
 Patients in both arms received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS).
 Additional outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), both assessed by independent, central, blinded radiological review using RECIST (version 1.0).
 In the intent to treat (all randomized) population, the median age was 63 years (range 27-88 years) with 42% &#x2265; 65 years of age; 58% were men; 93% were White and KPS was 90-100 in 60%.
 Disease characteristics included 46% of patients with 3 or more metastatic sites; 84% of patients had liver metastasis; and the location of the primary pancreatic lesion was in the head of pancreas (43%), body (31%), or tail (25%).
 Results for overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate are shown in Table 13.
