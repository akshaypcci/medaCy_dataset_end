  5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
  5.1 Serious Allergic Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis
  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause severe, including fatal, allergic reactions  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.3)].
 Premedicate with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), (2.4), and (2.8)].
 Have medications for the treatment of allergic reactions available for immediate use during administration.
 Signs and symptoms of severe allergic reactions may include fever, rigors or chills, sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea during or within 48 hours of infusion.
 Immediately interrupt BEXXAR infusions for severe reactions and provide appropriate medical and supportive care measures.
 Permanently, discontinue the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients who develop serious allergic reactions.
  5.2 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias
 Patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen experienced severe (NCI CTC 315 grade 3-4) and prolonged neutropenia (63%), thrombocytopenia (53%), and anemia (29%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 The time to nadir was 4 to 7 weeks and the duration of cytopenias was approximately 30 days.
 Due to the variable nature of the onset of cytopenias, monitor patients with weekly complete blood counts for up to 12 weeks.
 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should not be administered to patients with &gt;25% 320 lymphoma marrow involvement, platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3, or neutrophil count &lt;1,500 cells/mm3.
  5.3 Radiation Exposure
 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen contains Iodine-131.
 Follow institutional radiation safety practices and applicable federal guidelines to minimize radiation exposure during handling and after administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
 Advise patients of the risks of radiation exposure of household contacts, pregnant women, and small children and of the steps to be taken to reduce these risks.
  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen should be administered only by physicians enrolled in the certification program for dose calculation and administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
Further information regarding the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen certification program is available by phone at 1-877-423-9927.
  5.4 Secondary Malignancies
  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia may occur with the use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 10% of patients enrolled in clinical trials and 3% of patients enrolled in the expanded access program (median follow-up of 39 and 27 months, respectively).
 The median time to development of MDS or leukemia was 31 months [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 Non-hematologic malignancies may occur with the use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and were reported in 5% of patients enrolled in clinical trials or the expanded access program.
 In the absence of controlled studies, the relative risk of secondary malignancies in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen cannot be determined [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 5.5 Hypothyroidism
 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
 Initiate thyroid-blocking medications at least 24 hours before administering the dosimetric dose and continue until 14 days after the therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
 The risk of hypothyroidism is likely to be increased in patients who do not complete the recommended thyroid-protective regimen.
Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level before treatment and annually thereafter.
  5.6 Embryo-fetal Toxicity
 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman including severe, and possibly irreversible, neonatal hypothyroidism.
 Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus.
 Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen during pregnancy for hypothyroidism at time of delivery and during the neonatal period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
 Males and females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after the therapeutic dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].
  5.7 Excessive Radiation Exposure in Patients With Impaired Renal Function
 There are no data regarding the safety of administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in patients with impaired renal function.
 Since the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is primarily cleared through the kidneys, the rate of excretion of radiolabeled iodine is expected to be decreased in patients with impaired renal function or obstructive uropathy, which may result 370 in increased patient exposure to I-131 tositumomab.
 [See Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]
  5.8 Immunization
 The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and the ability of patients who have received the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response to any vaccine have not been studied.
Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients recently treated with BEXXAR.
  6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
  The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:
 Serious Allergic Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
 Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
 Secondary malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
 Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
  The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen (per-patient incidence greater than 25%) were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia,  infections (including pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections),  infusion reactions, asthenia, fever, and nausea [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].
 The most common serious adverse reactions in patients receiving the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen were severe and prolonged cytopenias, infections (including pneumonia, bacteremia, septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections), serious allergic reactions (including bronchospasm and angioedema), infusion reactions, and secondary leukemia and  myelodysplastic syndrome [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].
  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
 Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
 The reported safety data reflects exposure to the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in 230 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma enrolled in 5 clinical trials using the recommended dose and schedule.
 Patients were followed for a median of 39 months; 79% were followed for at least 12 months for survival and selected adverse reactions.
Patients had a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, a median age of 55 years, and 60% were male.
 Twenty-seven percent (27%) had transformation to a higher grade histology; 29% had intermediate-grade histology, and 2% had high-grade histology (IWF); 68% had Ann Arbor stage IV disease.
 Patients enrolled in these studies were not permitted to have prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or irradiation to more than 25% of the marrow space.
 Data on serious adverse reactions and human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) and TSH levels were obtained from an additional 765 patients enrolled in the expanded access program and used to supplement the characterization of delayed adverse reactions.
 Patients in the expanded access program had fewer prior chemotherapy regimens (2 versus 3) and a higher proportion had low-grade histology (77% versus 70%) compared to patients in clinical trials.

 c Grade 4 toxicity was assumed if patient had documented Grade 3 toxicity and was missing 2 or more weeks of hematology data between Week 5 and Week 9.
  Prolonged and Severe Cytopenias: The incidence and duration of severe cytopenias are shown in Table 3.
 Sixty-three (27%) patients received one or more hematologic supportive care measures following the therapeutic dose including G-CSF, epoetin alfa, platelet transfusions, and lacked red blood cell transfusions.
 Twenty-eight (12%) patients experienced hemorrhagic adverse reactions.
  Infections: One hundred and four patients (45%) patients experienced one or more infections.
 Twenty (9%) experienced serious infections including pneumonia, bacteremia,  septicemia, bronchitis, and skin infections.
 Allergic (Hypersensitivity) Reactions: Fourteen patients (6%) experienced one or more of 440 the following adverse reactions: allergic reaction, facial edema, injection site hypersensitivity,  anaphylactic reaction, laryngismus, and serum sickness.
 Infusion-related Adverse Reactions: Infusion reactions including fever, rigors or chills,  sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea occurred during or within 48 hours of infusion.
 Sixty-seven patients (29%) experienced fever, rigors/chills, or sweating within 14 days following the dosimetric dose.
 All patients in the clinical studies received pretreatment with acetaminophen and an antihistamine.
  Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)/Secondary Leukemia: The incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia among the 230 patients included in the clinical studies was 10%  (24/230), with a median follow-up of 39 months and a median time to development of 34 months.
 The cumulative incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia was 4.7% at 2 years and 15% at 5 years.
The incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia among the 765 patients in the expanded access program was 3% (20/765), with a median follow-up of 27 months and a median time to development of 31 months.
 The cumulative incidence of MDS/secondary leukemia in this patient population was 1.6% at 2 years and 6% at 5 years.
  Secondary Malignancies: Of the 995 patients in clinical studies and the expanded access programs, there were 65 secondary malignancies reported in 54 patients (5%) in clinical studies and the expanded access program.
 These included non-melanoma skin cancers (26), colorectal  cancer (7), head and neck cancer (6), breast cancer (5), lung cancer (4), bladder cancer (4), melanoma (3), and gastric cancer (2).
   Hypothyroidism: Of the 230 patients in the clinical studies, 203 patients did not have elevated TSH at study entry.
 Of these, 137 patients had at least one post-treatment TSH value available and were not taking thyroid hormonal treatment at study entry.
 With a median  463 up period of 46 months, the incidence of hypothyroidism (elevated TSH or initiation of thyroid replacement therapy) was 18% with a median time to development of 16 months.
 The cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism at 2 and 5 years in these 137 patients were 11% and 19%, respectively.
 Onset of hypothyroidism has occurred up to 90 months post-treatment.
 The cumulative incidence and median time to development of hypothyroidism were similar in the expanded access program.
  6.2 Immunogenicity
 There is a potential for immunogenicity with therapeutic proteins such as tositumomab.
 Serum samples from 989 chemotherapy-relapsed or refractory patients included in the clinical studies or the expanded access program were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies to the Fc portion of IgG1 murine immunoglobulin.
 One percent of the patients (11/989) had a positive serology for HAMA prior to treatment.
 The post-treatment 476 incidence of HAMA seropositivity is summarized in Table 4.
   Table 4.
Incidence of HAMA Seropositivity Among Patients With Chemotherapy- refractory or Relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Receiving the BEXXAR Therapeutic Regimen Chemotherapy- Percent Kaplan-Meier estimate of HAMA positivity  refractory or relapsed patients
 HAMA positive 6 months 12 months 18 months
 In clinical trials 23/219 (11%) 6% 17% 21%
 In expanded-access program 57/569 (10%) 7% 12% 13%
  In a study of 76 previously untreated patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, the incidence of conversion to HAMA zeropositivity was 70%, with a median time to development of 27 days.
 Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.
 For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to BEXXAR with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
  6.3 Postmarketing Experience
 The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the  BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
 Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
 Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including fatal anaphylaxis.
 Nervous system disorders: Axonal neuropathy leading to quadriparesis.
  7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
  No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with tositumomab or I-131 499 tositumomab.
  8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
  8.1 Pregnancy
 Pregnancy: Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]: There are no studies of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen in pregnant women or animals.
 Based on the transplacental  passage of I-131, administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to a pregnant woman can cause fetal harm including severe and possibly irreversible neonatal hypothyroidism.
 Limited data suggest an increased risk of miscarriage up to a year following I-131 treatment.
 Inform patients who are pregnant or become pregnant after the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen about the potential hazard to a fetus.
 Evaluate infants born to mothers treated with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen for hypothyroidism at the time of delivery and during the 510 neonatal period.
  8.3 Nursing Mothers
 Because immunoglobulins are secreted in human milk, it is expected that tositumomab would be present in human milk.
 Radiolabeled iodine is excreted in breast milk and may reach concentrations equal to or greater than maternal plasma concentrations.
 Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, advise women to discontinue nursing or to consider alternative treatment, taking into account the importance of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen to the mother.
  8.4 Pediatric Use
 The safety and effectiveness of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen have not been established in children.
  8.5 Geriatric Use 525 Clinical studies of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
  8.6 Renal Impairment
 Use of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen has not been studied in patients with renal 531 impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
  8.7 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential
  Contraception: Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after treatment ends to avoid the embryo-fetal effects of the radioisotope and the risk of increased pregnancy loss during that time period.
  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen exposes the testes to radiation [see Dosage and 540 Administration (2.9)].
 Because of the potential for mutagenesis in male gametes, males of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen and for 12 months after treatment ends.
  Infertility: The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen results in radiation exposure of the ovaries 545 and testes.
Based on published studies examining patients treated with I-131, the BEXXAR 546 therapeutic regimen may cause transient ovarian or testicular dysfunction.
Radiation effects may persist for up to 12 months following treatment.
  10 OVERDOSAGE
  The maximum radiation activity of the I-131 component of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen, administered to 4 patients, were doses calculated to deliver between 85 cGy and 88 cGy total body irradiation.
 The incidence of NCI Grade 4 cytopenias was increased in these 4 patients compared to patients who received the recommended therapeutic dose for the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen.
  11 DESCRIPTION
  The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen is composed of the monoclonal antibody tositumomab, and the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, I-131 tositumomab.
 Tositumomab is a murine IgG2a lambda monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen, produced in mammalian cells.
 The approximate molecular weight of tositumomab is 150 kD.
  Tositumomab is supplied as a sterile, pyrogen-free, clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow, preservative-free solution that must be diluted before intravenous administration.
The formulation contains 100 mg/mL maltose, 8.5 mg/mL sodium chloride, 1 mg/mL phosphate, 1 mg/mL potassium hydroxide, and Water for Injection, USP.
 The pH is approximately 7.2.
 I-131 tositumomab is tositumomab covalently linked to Iodine-131.
I-131 tositumomab is supplied as a sterile, clear, preservative-free liquid.
 The formulation for I-131 tositumomab contains 0.9 to 1.3 mg/mL ascorbic acid, 1 to 2 mg/mL maltose (dosimetric dose) or 9 to 15 mg/mL maltose (therapeutic dose), 4.4% to 6.6% (w/v) povidone, and 8.5 to 9.5 mg/mL sodium 568 chloride.
The pH is approximately 7.0.
569 570 Physical/Radiochemical Characteristics of Iodine-131: Iodine-131 decays with beta and gamma emissions with a physical half-life of 8.04 days.
 The principal beta emission has a mean energy of 191.6 keV, and the principal gamma emission has energy of 364.5 keV.
  External Radiation: The specific gamma ray constant for Iodine-131 is 2.2 R/millicurie hour at 1 cm.
Use a 2.55 cm thickness of Pb (to attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1,000) to minimize radiation exposure from this radionuclide.
 The fraction of Iodine-131 radioactivity that remains in the vial x days after the date of calibration is 2-(x/8.04).
   Physical decay is presented in Table 5.

  12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
  12.1 Mechanism of Action
 Tositumomab binds specifically to an epitope within the extracellular domain of the CD20 molecule.
 The CD20 molecule is expressed on normal B lymphocytes (pre-B lymphocytes 587 to mature B lymphocytes) and on B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
 The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not internalized following antibody binding.
 The BEXXAR therapeutic regimen induces cell death by emitting ionizing radiation to CD20-expressing lymphocytes or neighboring cells.
In addition to cell death mediated by the radioisotope, other possible mechanisms of action include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,   cytotoxicity, and CD20-mediated apoptosis.
  12.2 Pharmacodynamics
 In two clinical studies (one in chemotherapy-naive patients and one in heavily pretreated patients), the administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen resulted in sustained depletion of circulating CD20-positive cells.
 The assessment of circulating lymphocytes in these patients did not distinguish normal from malignant cells; consequently, recovery of normal B cell numbers was not directly assessed.
 At 7 weeks following treatment, the median number of circulating CD20-positive cells was zero (range: 0 to 490 cells/mm3) with recovery beginning at approximately 12 weeks.
 At 6 months following treatment, 8 (14%) of 58 chemotherapy-naive
   602 patients and 6 (32%) of 19 heavily pretreated patients had CD20-positive cell counts below 603 normal limits.
 There was no consistent effect of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen on   serum IgG, IgA, or IgM levels.
  12.3 Pharmacokinetics 607 A pharmacokinetic study of I-131 tositumomab determined that a 475-mg predose of unlabeled antibody decreased splenic targeting and increased the terminal half-life of the radiolabeled antibody.
The median blood clearance following administration of 485 mg of tositumomab in 110 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas was 68.2 mg/hr (range: 30.2 to 611 260.8 mg/hr).
  Patients with high tumor burden, splenomegaly, or bone marrow involvement were noted to have a larger volume of distribution, faster clearance, and shorter terminal half-life.
  The total body clearance, as measured by total body gamma camera counts, was dependent on the same factors noted for blood clearance.
Patient-specific dosing, based on total body clearance, provided a consistent radiation dose despite variable pharmacokinetics, by allowing each patient's administered activity to be adjusted for individual patient variables.
  The median total body effective half-life, as measured by total body gamma camera counts, in 980 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 67 hours (range: 28 to 115 hours).
  Elimination of Iodine-131 occurs by decay (Table 5) and excretion in the urine.
Five days following the dose, the whole body clearance was 67% of the injected dose.
Ninety-eight percent 621 (98%) of the clearance was accounted for in the urine.
  13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
  13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
 No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen or to determine its effects on fertility in males or females.
 However, Iodine I-131 is a potential carcinogen and mutagen.
  Administration of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen exposes the testes and ovaries to radiation [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)].
  629 14 CLINICAL STUDIES
  The clinical benefit of the BEXXAR therapeutic regimen was established in a single-arm clinical trial conducted in 40 patients with low-grade, transformed low-grade, or follicular   lymphoma.
 Patients had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60%, a granulocyte count of 1500 cells/mm3, a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3, less than or equal to 25% of the intra-trabecular marrow space involved by lymphoma, and no evidence of progressive disease arising in a field irradiated with &gt;3500 cGy within one year of completion of irradiation.
 This study enrolled 40 patients with low-grade or transformed low-grade or follicular large-cell lymphoma whose disease had not responded to, or had progressed following, at least 4 doses of rituximab therapy.
The median age was 57 years (range: 35 to 78 years); the median 640 time from diagnosis to protocol entry was 50 months (range: 12 to 170 months); and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 4 (range: 1 to 11).
 Overall, 35 of the 40 patients were rituximab-refractory (defined as no response or a response of less than 6 months' duration following rituximab therapy).
 The main outcome measure was overall response rate as determined by an independent panel that reviewed patient records and radiologic studies (Table 6).
  Table 6.

 Complete Response Rate  95% CIa 33% (19%, 49%)
 Complete Response Response Duration (months) Median 95% CIa Range NR (15, NR) 4 to 38+
  a CI = confidence interval
 b NR = not reached, median duration of follow-up = 26 months
 c Complete response rate = pathologic and clinical complete responses
  The results of this study were supported by demonstration of durable objective responses in 4 single-arm studies enrolling 190 patients evaluable for efficacy with rituximab-naive, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with or without transformation, who had relapsed following or were refractory to chemotherapy.
  In these studies, the overall response rates ranged from 47% to 64% and the median durations of response ranged from 12 to 18 months.
